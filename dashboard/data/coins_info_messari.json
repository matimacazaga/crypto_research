Some of the most prominent projects that preceded Bitcoin include: Digicash, b-money, Hashcash, e-gold, and Bit Gold. Bitcoin is often associated with Austrian economic theories, anarcho-capitalist principles, and general libertarian politicking by virtue of the exclusive developer community to whom Nakamoto first released their white paper, certain protocol design characteristics, and the political affiliations of early Bitcoin investors. \n\nConception to Launch\nOn October 31, 2008, at the peak of the Global Financial Crisis, just six weeks after the infamous investment bank, Lehman Brothers, declared bankruptcy, the pseudonymous <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/satoshi-nakamoto\">Satoshi Nakamoto</a> released the Bitcoin whitepaper to the cryptography mailing list. Titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\", the whitepaper proposed a new electronic cash system that would allow fully peer-to-peer online payments without reliance on trusted third parties. Soon after the release of the whitepaper, Satoshi implemented the Bitcoin software as open-source code. On 3 January 2009, the Bitcoin network came into existence with Satoshi mining the genesis block of Bitcoin, which included a now-famous \"The Times\" headline in the <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/coinbase-transaction\">coinbase</a> both to prove the network\u2019s fair launch and to make a political statement about the global financial system. The event marked the birth of the world's first non-sovereign, decentralized, digital money.\n\nPost Launch\n<a href=\"https://messari.io/person/hal-finney\">Hal Finney</a>, who invented the first reusable proof-of-work system (RPoW) in 2004, received the first Bitcoin transaction (10 bitcoins) on January 12, 2009. In 2010, the first known commercial transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/laszlo-hanyecz\">Laszlo Hanyecz</a> bought two Papa John's pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins. \n\nIn August 2010, a major vulnerability in the Bitcoin protocol was spotted and exploited in the Bitcoin network, allowing users to create an infinite amount of bitcoins. The transactions exploiting the vulnerability were quickly spotted and erased for the Bitcoin blockchain, with the vulnerability being patched in a network upgrade of the Bitcoin protocol. This was the only major security flaw found and exploited in Bitcoin's history.\n\nIn December 2010, amidst rising publicity from Bitcoin's use in financing Wikileaks, Satoshi Nakamoto, disappeared from involvement with Bitcoin. It is unknown why Satoshi disappeared from the project, although some believe Satoshi, cognizant of past struggles to launch a digital currency, recognized that a leader of the Bitcoin project could be a central point of failure. It is estimated that Nakamoto had mined about one million bitcoins before disappearing in 2010 when he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository over to <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/gavin-andresen\">Gavin Andresen</a>.\n\nSilk Road & Mt. Gox\nOne of the most iconic early use cases for Bitcoin was the Silk Road. Launched in early 2011, the Silk Road was a darknet marketplace that allowed users to buy and sell a wide variety of goods including, most notably, illegal drugs. Underpinning the Silk Road was the Tor network, which allowed users to browse the Silk Road anonymously and securely without potential traffic monitoring, and Bitcoin which provided a censorship-resistant payment rail for pseudonymous transactions. Over the course of its life, it is estimated that the Silk Road facilitated more than $1.2 billion in transactions, collecting over $80 million in sales commissions, leveraging the Bitcoin network as its payment rail. The site was shut down in 2013 when the FBI took advantage of the Silk Road\u2019s centralized infrastructure, arresting founder <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/ross-ulbricht\">Ross Ulbricht</a>, and shuttering the site.\n\nFounded by <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/jed-mccaleb\">Jed McCaleb</a> in July 2010, and led by <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/mark-karpeles\">Mark Karpeles</a> until it collapsed, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/mtgox\">Mt. Gox</a> was one of the earliest Bitcoin exchanges in the world. Based in Tokyo, Japan, the exchange would go on to handle over 70% of all bitcoin (BTC) transactions worldwide at its peak. Known for its chronic security issues, Mt. Gox was infamously hacked in 2014, losing 850,000 bitcoins worth about $450 million at the time. The hack sent the price of Bitcoin, which was in the midst of one of its first major price bubbles, plummeting. Bitcoin would sink into a bear market with prices not recovering until the 2017 bull run.\n\n2017 Bubble & Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork\nThe 2017 price bubble was a watershed moment for Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin rose more than 1900% from just under $1,000 at the beginning of the year to near $20,000 at its peak in December. At its peak, Bitcoin's market capitalization eclipsed $325 billion. Along with the proliferation of Initial Coin Offerings, powered by Ethereum, Bitcoin's incredible 2017 run propelled cryptocurrency into mainstream consciousness, among the most discussed phenomena of 2017.\n\nAlso notable in 2017, Bitcoin experienced its <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork\">most contentious fork to date</a>. Amidst rising transaction fees on Bitcoin and increasingly divergent views on scaling Bitcoin, an agreement was reached amongst prominent Bitcoin stakeholders in what is now known as the \"New York Agreement\". The agreement was to support a set of network upgrades called SegWit2x. The proposal was backed by over 80% of Bitcoin's hash rate. However, despite the desires of miners, users wanted to activate <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/segregated-witness\">SegWit</a> without the 2MB block size increase, the philosophy underpinning this decision being that the users controlled the network, not miners and Bitcoin businesses. Subsequently, they set a date (August 1, 2017) where Bitcoin would soft fork to support SegWit and keep the 1MB block size. Enough nodes signaled support for it that they forced miners to accept or have their blocks rejected by the network. A faction of the bigger blocks camp, rejected SegWit altogether, citing frustrations with the prioritization of SegWit over bigger blocks, and on August 1, 2017, they launched a hard fork of Bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash, with 8MB block limits. These events marked, one end, a landmark demonstration of power by the users of the Bitcoin network, and on the other end, the first great schism within the Bitcoin community.\n\n2018 - 2019\nAfter peaking in December 2017, Bitcoin, along with the rest of the cryptocurrency market in January 2018, crashed, sending the cryptocurrency market into its latest bear market. Since then Bitcoin has dropped as low as $3,200, more than 80% below its ATH. However, while prices have yet to recover to 2017 highs, the institutionalization of Bitcoin has picked up significantly. Traditional Wall Street institutions including Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Intercontinental Exchange, and Fidelity have all launched cryptocurrency offerings, opening up the market to institutional investors. There are now several regulated exchanges and custodians. Furthermore, regulatory clarity around Bitcoin has improved dramatically with SEC Chairman, Jay Clayton, revealing at a Congressional hearing in February 2018, that the SEC does not consider Bitcoin to be a security.\n\nSince it reached its cycle low in February 2019, Bitcoin's price has recovered considerably, rising as high as $13,000 in June. With the recent announcements of Facebook's Libra project and China's Central Bank digital currency, governments and multinational corporations around the world have begun to look at cryptocurrencies more seriously. American officials are debating a digital dollar and lawmakers around the world are considering the central bank digital currency (CBDC) options. Furthermore, there have been numerous cryptocurrency-related hearings since Libra was announced. China has recently <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/china-blockchain-madness\">announced</a> blockchain was a revolutionary technology and that it would make blockchain technology a strategic imperative for the country. Bitcoin's price rose more than 40% after the announcement, its highest intraday movement since 2011.\n\n2020 - 2021\nBitcoin traded sideways into 2020, but the onset of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic saw world markets take the biggest dips since at least the 2007-08 Mortgage Crisis. Bitcoin did not escape the dip \u2013 in less than 48 hours it lost half of its value, going below $4,000 for the first time since March of 2019. Luckily for bitcoiners, bitcoin rebounded, returning to its pre-pandemic price in less than a month.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s ascent recovery out of the March turmoil drew wider media and institutional attention and lent credibility to its store of value narrative. Although it remained around $10,000 throughout Ethereum\u2019s firey <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/a-data-driven-look-at-the-end-of-defi-s-summer\">DeFi summer</a>, bitcoin would start to trend upwards into the fall and by early November bitcoin hit $14,000. Whether it was unprecedented levels of money printing by the Federal Reserve, its V-shaped recovery in April, or direct stimulus payments to millions of Americans, it was clear bitcoin wasn\u2019t done at $14,000 as it crossed $20,000 for the first time ever on December 16, 2020. Two weeks later it hit $28,000. Then, on January 8, 2021, bitcoin set a new all-time high of $41,429.38. Since hitting $41,000 bitcoin has mostly drifted in the $30,000.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price wasn\u2019t the only thing rapidly accelerating in 2020. Institutional adoption skyrocketed. Led by Paul Tudor Jones of Microstrategy (  $1 billion), institutions joined the bitcoin world en masse. From insurance companies like MassMutual ($100 million) to investment firms like Ruffer ($744 million) new groups <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/the-potential-impact-of-increased-capital-allocation-to-bitcoin\">continue</a> to adopt bitcoin. And institutions aren\u2019t alone \u2013 entrepreneurs like Elon Musk and politicians like Miami Mayor Francis Suarez have increasingly promoted bitcoin. Even athletes have joined the space, as NFL player Russell Okung partnered with Bitcoin Lightning Company <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/zap\">Zap</a> to become the first professional sports player ever to be paid in bitcoin\n\n", "issuing_organizations": []}, "roadmap": [{"title": "Whitepaper", "date": "2008-10-31T04:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": "Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper"}, {"title": "Genesis Block", "date": "2009-01-03T05:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": "Bitcoin's genesis block is mined"}, {"title": "M-of-N Standard Transactions", "date": "2011-10-02T04:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": "BIP 011 implemented M-of-N-signatures required transactions as a new 'standard' transaction type.

Users (full nodes) adopt new rules according to their subjective views on what Bitcoin is and should be. If two or more individuals adopt the same set of rules, they form an inter-subjective social consensus of what \u201cBitcoin\u201d is. It is in this respect that many conceptualize Bitcoin as being set by a social contract. Every time rule changes are contemplated, the rules of the contract are decided and renegotiated continuously between stakeholders. Protocol changes are legitimized when users agree to adopt the new changes. Once adopted, the Bitcoin protocol automates the enforcement of the social contract.\n\nProcess Overview\nProtocol development is governed by a proposal process whereby anyone in the open-source Bitcoin community can submit <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/bitcoin-improvement-proposal-bip\">Bitcoin Improvement Proposals</a> (\"BIPs\"). After debate by the community, when consensus has emerged, the Bitcoin Core maintainers merge code changes into Bitcoin Core's GitHub Repository. Once new code has been implemented into the Bitcoin Core client, users of the network (full nodes) must be persuaded to adopt the new changes. Protocol changes are \u201cratified\u201d on-chain when the majority of the network adopts the upgrade and doesn\u2019t break consensus.\n\nOnce rules are adopted on-chain, all new transactions and block proposals are subject to the agreed-upon rules. Full nodes only accept new transactions and block proposals that are valid according to the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. Anything that is not valid will be rejected. Thus, miners must implement the prevailing rules of the network in order to participate in the block creation process. \n\nUser Activated Hard Fork\n2017's <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork\">User Activated Soft Fork Event</a> provided an illustrative case study on Bitcoin governance in practice. \n\nAs early as 2010, shortly after Satoshi implemented a block limit into Bitcoin, discussions around block size began. These discussions largely stayed in the background until 2017 when tensions within the Bitcoin community rose over rising transaction fees and increasingly divergent opinions on scaling Bitcoin. In May 2017, a meeting between miners, businesses, investors, and core developers took place at the Consensus conference in New York, in what is now referred to as the \"New York Agreement\". The product of this meeting was an agreement to support <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/segregated-witness\">SegWit</a> (a soft fork) and a 2MB block size (hard fork). \n\nKnown as SegWit2x, this proposal was backed by over 80% of the network\u2019s hash rate. However, despite the desires of miners, users wanted to activate SegWit without the block size increase. This plan was proposed as BIP 148, a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, from a pseudonymous developer named <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/shaolin-fry\">Shaolinfry</a>. Soon after, users set a date (August 1, 2017) where Bitcoin would soft fork to support SegWit and keep the 1MB block size. Eventually, enough nodes signaled support for it, forcing miners to accept or have their blocks rejected by the network. \n\nMany see this user-activated soft fork (UASF) as a pivotal moment in Bitcoin\u2019s history. The philosophy underpinning the event was that users controlled the network, not miners. The event not only illustrated the balance of power within Bitcoin's network, but also calmed suspicions that parties such as miners, businesses, or Bitcoin Core developers, controlled Bitcoin.

Buterin published the first Ethereum white paper later that year, describing a distributed computing platform for executing smart contracts and building <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/decentralized-applications-dapps\">decentralized applications (dApps)</a>. In 2014, Buterin and some other early contributors founded the <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ethereum-foundation\">Ethereum Foundation</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to Ethereum\u2019s research, core protocol development, and ecosystem growth. The foundation's first task was to host the Ethereum crowdsale, which raised 31,529 <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\">BTC</a> (~$18 million at the time) in exchange for about 60 million ether, and use the proceeds to fund the network's initial development. The Ethereum Foundation continues to be the primary funding organization, issuing grants to research teams and projects focused on Ethereum.\n\nThe rise of initial coin offerings (ICOs)\nEthereum's mainnet launched in July 2015, with the first live release known as Frontier. Shortly thereafter, Augur (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/augur\">REP</a>) conducted the first <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/initial-coin-offering-ico\">Initial Coin Offering (ICO)</a>, in which the startup sold its Ethereum-based REP tokens (created via the <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/erc-20\">ERC-20</a> standard) to help fund the project. The ability to develop and sell a newly generated token to help raise capital became an attractive method of fundraising because projects could circumvent the legal policies and costs required from traditional companies (until more recently). Ethereum-focused startups created thousands of new tokens since Augur's ICO, raising billions of dollars in the process.\n\nThe DAO hack\nIn April 2016, a decentralized venture fund known as <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/the-dao\">The DAO</a> hosted an ICO, raising ~$150 million in ETH in the process. A few months later (July 2016), an attacker exploited a bug in one of The DAO's smart contracts, enabling the guilty party to siphon 3.6 million ETH. A significant portion of the Ethereum community opted to revert the chain to remove The DAO and its subsequent hack from the network's history. The remaining stakeholders held the preservation of immutability in higher regard and refused to accept a ledger rewrite. The divide in the community led to a contentious hard fork a few weeks post-hack, causing a permanent split in the network. The legacy chain that did not reverse its transaction history is now known as Ethereum Classic (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum-classic\">$ETC</a>).\n\nThe path to scalability: Ethereum 2.0\nScalability is a known limitation for the current state of Ethereum. Periods of high user activity, as seen during the CryptoKitties launch in Nov. 2017 and the DeFi bonanza during the Summer of 2020, can cause transaction times and fees to skyrocket, which often prices out retail users and newcomers.\n\nThe potential shortcomings of Ethereum's current design are nothing new to Ethereum developers. Various teams have been working since the launch of Ethereum to upgrade the network to account for better scalability and security measures without compromising the community's values of decentralization. The current plan is to swap Ethereum's consensus layer from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and implement a scaling technique known as sharding in a massive upgrade called Serenity (also referred to as Ethereum 2.0).\n\nEthereum developers have broken down this upgrade into three or more phases to minimize complexity as they add more features. The first phase Phase 0 has a minimum launch date of Dec. 1, 2020. It will bring the Beacon Chain (the backbone of Ethereum 2.0) to life and enable the network to bootstrap a stable of validators to ensure network security.

Version 1.0 also featured a hardcoded gas limit of 5000 gas per block to prevent any issues with node installation. The gas limit lasted only a few days post-launch before being automatically removed. To avoid unwanted chain forks, Frontier contained Canary contracts as well.

Those block rewards incentivize miners to secure the network. Miners that find an uncle block also receive 87.5% of the base block reward. Uncle blocks occur when several distinct miners simultaneously mine a block. In this case, the block that has the most accumulated PoW is conserved, and others are rejected. Unlike the Bitcoin chain that does not reward miners for orphan blocks, the Ethereum chain does reward uncle block miners. Transaction fees, however, are not awarded to uncle block miners. As <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin\">Vitalik Buterin</a> notes, the initial intent behind rewarding uncle block miners was to avoid mining centralization caused by the network lag that smaller miners could endure:\n  \"This mechanic was originally introduced to reduce centralization pressures, by reducing the advantage that well-connected miners have over poorly connected miners.\"\n\nIn 2017, the difficulty bomb increased block times drastically, thus reducing the issuance rate. Indeed, the difficulty bomb, also known as \"ice age\" was initially designed as a mechanism to disincentivize miners to continue mining the Ethereum chain by making it exponentially harder to create a new block. This was meant to accelerate the transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake.\n\nThe Casper development and transition to Proof-of-Stake being delayed, <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin\">Vitalik Buterin</a> and <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/afri-schoedon\">Afri Schoeden</a> proposed to delay the difficulty bomb and reduce the block rewards from 5 Ether to 3 Ether, thus leaving the system in the same general state as before. This proposal, EIP 649, was included in the Byzantium hard fork which was implemented on October 16, 2017, at block 4,370,000, thus effectively reducing block rewards from 5 Ether to 3 Ether and delaying the difficulty bomb for approximately 1.4 years.\n\nOn February 28, 2019, at block 7,280,000, the Constantinople hard fork further reduced block rewards from 3 Ether to 2 Ether, and once again delayed the difficulty bomb for approximately 12 months with EIP 1234.\n\nThe Ethereum's Parity multi-sig wallet bug\n\nOn November 06, 2017, a vulnerability in the \"library\" smart contract code was exploited by an anonymous user. Subsequently, the user destroyed the library contract. This destruction locked forever a total amount of 513,774.16 Ether located in 587 multi-signatures parity wallets. <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/messari-proprietary-methods\">Messari Proprietary Methodology</a> to calculate liquid supply excludes any non-transferable coins. Thus, these locked Ether are considered illiquid and are not included in our liquid supply calculation.\n\nETH 2.0 and the transition to Casper Proof-of-Stake\n\nIn ETH 2.0, the Ethereum chain will be maintained via a new proof-of-stake system, where rewards will be distributed on a sliding scale based on the total amount staked on the network. The more total supply that\u2019s staked, the higher the system-wide issuance rate (to incentivize high cumulative participation). Although individual yields will decline as the staking participation increases. A table posted by <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin\">Vitalik Buterin</a> on Github lays out the sliding scale issuance rate. \n\n<a href=\"https://messari.io/person/justin-drake\">Justin Drake</a>, a researcher at the <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ethereum-foundation\">Ethereum Foundation</a>, argued that targeting 30,000,000 ETH at stake, long-term, \u201cseems about right for strong security.\u201d It would represent about 30% of the network and result in an approximate 3% annual inflation. Nevertheless, the penalties applied to validators going offline as well as the slashing penalties and the transaction fees burnt due to EIP 1559 will lead to the destruction of Ether, thus reducing the total net issuance amount.\n\nThe transition to Proof-of-Stake will occur in three or four stages, according to the latest specifications shared by the core developers:\nPhase 0, expected for Dec. 1, 2020, will initially increase issuance compared to the current level. This is due to the fact that both the Proof-of-Work and Beacon Chain will run simultaneously and rewards will be distributed on both chains, although the staking participation, and thus annual issuance on the Beacon Chain, will most likely be very low during this Phase.\nPhase 1, expected for Q4 2021, will allow finalizing the Proof-of-Work chain with Proof-of-Stake. The Proof-of-Work rewards will most likely be reduced to match an issuance rate between 0.5% and 1% (versus 4.5% before Phase 1). Both Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake rewards will co-exist and the global issuance rate should be around 1% at that stage.\nPhase 1.5, estimated for 2022, will mark when Ethereum 2.0 transfers will likely unlock, giving stakers access to their previously inaccessible staked ETH and accumulated rewards. These rewards and staking amounts will date back to the launch of the Beacon Chain.\nPhase 2, estimated for 2023, will progressively lead to an increase of staking participation, thus increasing the annual issuance rate, while Proof-of-Work will simultaneously progressively disappear.\n\n", "general_emission_type": "Inflationary", "precise_emission_type": "Fixed Issuance", "is_capped_supply": false, "max_supply": null}, "consensus": {"consensus_details": "Modified GHOST protocol\nThe Ethereum White Paper states Ethereum uses a modified version of the \"Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree\" (GHOST) protocol to distinguish the \"longest\" base chain (the chain with the most accumulated Proof-of-Work backing it) from forks. <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/nakamoto-consensus\">Nakamoto Consensus</a>, the implementation used by Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\">$BTC</a>) and its forks, is problematic in networks with fast confirmation times (i.e., block times) like Ethereum. Quick block times lead to a higher stale or orphan rate, which can split mining resources among competing forks and reduce overall network security. Accelerated confirmation times also increases the likelihood a single mining pool could obtain a majority of the hashpower on a given chain.\n\nThe GHOST protocol attempts to solve this issue of network security by including orphan blocks in the calculation of the longest chain. Therefore, the GHOST model determines the valid chain by weighing the parent and further ancestors as well as the number of stale descendants. The protocol also rewards the mining of orphan blocks directly connected to the longest chain to combat potential centralization concerns. Orphan block miners do not receive any transaction fees, only a portion of the block subsidy, as stale transactions are not considered valid.\n\nSome say GHOST works better in theory than in practice, claiming Ethereum further modified its consensus implementation before (or soon after) launch to avoid security complications. Others suggest the Ethereum consensus model better resembles Nakamoto consensus or a modified version of the Inclusive protocol. But the inclusion of EIP-100 in the Byzantium fork changed Ethereum's difficulty calculation algorithm to include orphan blocks, which indicates the proposed modified GHOST implementation is intact. Regardless of the security model classification, Ethereum continues to reward orphan block miners with 87.5% of the base block reward.\n\nMining\nEthereum miners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks by running the Ethash <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\">Proof-of-Work (PoW)</a> algorithm. In this process, miners compete to discover a valid hash, using the Keccak-256 and Keccak-512 hash functions, as defined by Ethereum's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Unlike Bitcoin's biweekly adjustments, Ethereum recalculates its difficulty level every block based on the time between the two previous blocks.\n\nCryptographers designed Ethash to be <a href=\"https://messari.io/blog/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics\">ASIC</a>-resistant by making it memory intensive for specialized mining chips. But the popularity of Ethereum led mining chip manufacturer Bitmain to release the first ASICs miners for Ethash in April 2018. The majority of the Ethereum remains opposed to ASIC miners, as evidenced by its support for the ProgPoW EIP (a likely inclusion in the second Istanbul hard fork).

External contracts can create and sign messages to send to both types of accounts, while contract accounts can only execute transactions automatically in response to a message they have received.

It is a Turing complete virtual machine featuring a specific language \u201cEVM bytecode,\u201d typically written in a higher-level language called Solidity. Every operation on the EVM requires computational effort and memory. Ethereum node operators and miners provide these scarce resources to application developers and network users in exchange for gas. Different operations require different amounts of gas, and the user can specify how much they are willing to pay in ETH for each unit of gas. The amount of gas required for the transaction, along with the price paid, becomes the transaction cost. Every transaction also had a gas limit to prevent attacks from overloading blocks, which could slow down block production.\n\nDeveloper tools and token standards\nEthereum adopted <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/erc-20\">Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) 20</a> in late 2015 as a standard for Ethereum smart contracts to issue tokens on the platform. The majority of tokens built on Ethereum are ERC-20 compliant, meaning they follow a standard set of rules defining how they are created and used. Another more popular token rule set is ERC-721 with standardizes the issuance of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) where any given token is distinguishable from another making them popular for gaming.\n\nEthereum 2.0\nAs Ethereum transitions to Eth 2.0, it will undergo significant changes to its design. It will transition from <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\">Proof-of-Work</a> to <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/proof-of-stake\">Proof-of-Stake</a> and feature a sharding architecture. Currently, nodes must validate every transaction to maintain an updated global state. The new sharding model segments the network into various groups (called shards) and randomly assigns nodes to each shard. Rather than having to monitor the entire chain, nodes only have to validate their respective shard(s). Individual shards shared their transaction details with the Beacon Chain, which acts as the backbone of Ethereum 2.0. The Beacon Chain serves to validate the transactions on each shard, helping the entire network reach consensus. It also identifies dishonest validators and initiates penalties in the form of slashing, in which a portion of a validator's stake is removed from circulation. Eth 2.0 will also replace the EVM with Ethereum WebAssembly (eWASM), which intends to translate coding logic more efficiently and help improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability.", "client_repositories": [{"name": "go-ethereum", "link": "https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum", "license_type": "LGPL 3.0"}, {"name": "aleth", "link": "https://github.com/ethereum/aleth", "license_type": "GPL 3.0"}, {"name": "trinity", "link": "https://github.com/ethereum/trinity", "license_type": "MIT"}]}, "security": {"audits": [{"title": "Gas Economics", "date": null, "type": null, "details": "[https://github.com/LeastAuthority/ethereum-analyses/blob/master/GasEcon.md](https://github.com/LeastAuthority/ethereum-analyses/blob/master/GasEcon.md)"}, {"title": "Analysis of Ethash, Ethereum's Proof-of-Work puzzle", "date": null, "type": null, "details": "[https://github.com/LeastAuthority/ethereum-analyses/blob/master/PoW.md](https://github.com/LeastAuthority/ethereum-analyses/blob/master/PoW.md)"}], "known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities": [{"title": "The DAO Hack", "date": "2016-06-01T04:00:00Z", "type": "Hack", "details": "An attacker exploited a bug in one of The DAO smart contracts, allowing the guilty party to steal 3.6 million ETH.

Tether was one of the earliest stablecoins created, built upon Mastercoin (Omni), which was a protocol layer for Bitcoin that introduced the stablecoin concept to the world in 2012. Tether pioneered what is now known as a fiat-collateralized stablecoin model, and is now the most widely used stablecoin today.\n\nTether was created as an attempt to solve two major issues with existing cryptocurrencies: high volatility and convertibility between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. To address these perceived issues Tether created a cryptocurrency that is fully backed 1:1 by deposits of U.S. dollars held at banks. On Ethereum, USDT tokens are represented as ERC-20 tokens, while on Bitcoin, Tether utilizes the Omni layer, to represent USDT tokens. While the tokens themselves operate in a decentralized network, Hong Kong based <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/tether-limited\">Tether Ltd</a> is solely responsible for creating and redeeming tokens as well as maintaining the 1:1 deposit backing. \n\nExchanges have been the primary users of USDT as an alternative to fiat currencies, reducing or eliminating the need to maintain outside banking relationships. Notable exchanges that utilize the token include <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/bitfinex\">Bitfinex</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/bittrex\">Bittrex</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/binance-holdings-ltd\">Binance</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/coinbase\">Coinbase</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/kraken\">Kraken</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/huobi\">Huobi</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/poloniex\">Poloniex</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/liquid\">Liquid.io</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/gate-io\">Gate.io</a>, and <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/okex\">OKEx</a>. Tether Ltd shares many executives and has strong ties with Hong Kong based Bitfinex with both sharing the same parent organization <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ifinex-inc\">iFinex Inc</a>.\n\nSince its founding in 2014, Tether has been the <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/history-of-tether\">subject of ongoing controversy </a>due to the failure of Tether to provided audited financial statements proving it has adequate reserves backing USDT. Historically Tether has failed to disclose its banking relationships, only recently announcing its banking partners in November 2018 to quell rumors about its solvency raised by associated crypto exchange, Bitfinex.\n\nIn March 2019, Tether updated its disclosure statement claiming that its tokens are no longer backed 100% by U.S. dollar deposits. Tether is instead now backed 100% backed by reserves, which include traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities.

Its goal is to provide a platform that enables developers to create <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-applications-dapps\">decentralized applications (dApps)</a> without needing to design around performance bottlenecks. Solana features a new timestamp system called Proof-of-History (PoH) that enables automatically ordered transactions. It also uses a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm to help secure the network. Additional design goals include sub-second settlement times, low transaction costs, and support for all LLVM compatible smart contract languages.", "official_links": [{"name": "Whitepaper", "link": "https://github.com/solana-labs/whitepaper/blob/master/solana-whitepaper-en.pdf"}, {"name": "Website", "link": "https://solana.com/"}, {"name": "Github", "link": "https://github.com/solana-labs"}, {"name": "Medium", "link": "https://medium.com/solana-labs"}, {"name": "Twitter", "link": "https://twitter.com/solana"}, {"name": "YouTube", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9AdQPUe4BdVJ8M9X7wxHUA"}, {"name": "Telegram", "link": "https://t.me/solana"}, {"name": "Discord", "link": "https://discordapp.com/invite/pquxPsq"}]}, "background": {"background_details": "Solana's origins date back to late 2017 when founder Anatoly Yakovenko published a whitepaper draft detailing a new timekeeping technique for distributed systems called Proof of History (PoH). In blockchains like Bitcoin and Etheruem, one of the limitations to scalability is the time required to reach a consensus on the order of transactions. Anatoly believed his new technique could automate the transaction ordering process for blockchains, providing a key piece that would enable crypto networks to scale well-beyond their capabilities at the time.\n\nAnatoly later teamed up with former Qualcomm colleague Greg Fitzgerald to build a single blockchain network in Rust that used PoH as its \"internal clock.\" The two released the first internal testnet (with demo) and official version of the project's whitepaper in Feb. 2018. Another former Qualcomm cohort, Stephen Akridge, suggested that offloading signature verification to graphics processors could further increase transaction throughput (i.e., scalability). Anatoly recruited Greg and Stephen, and three others to found the company that would eventually become Solana Labs. The founding team included former Apple engineers in addition to the Qualcomm veterans. They initially named the project Loom but later rebranded it to Solana to avoid confusion with the Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution, Loom Network.\n\nSolana Labs began raising funds to build its new crypto network in Q2 2018. Between Apr. 2018 and Jul. 2019, the team raised a little over $20 million in various private token sales. They announced the sales as a single Series A in late-July 2019. The fundraising effort ran parallel to Solana's work on the protocol, which went through several permissioned testnet phases before the team announced its public incentivized testnet, called Tour de SOL, in Q3 2020. The first stage of Tour de SOL went live in Feb. 2020, and it continues to run alongside the Mainnet Beta version of Solana today.\n\nSolana launched on Mainnet Beta in Mar. 2020, shortly after raising $1.76 million in a public token auction hosted on CoinList. The project's beta network featured basic transaction capabilities and smart contract support.

After the lockup period ends, these tokens will vest monthly for another two years (expected to fully vest by Jan. 2023).\n\nThe Grant Pool and Community Reserve (both overseen by the Solana Foundation) contain ~38% of the initial SOL supply combined. These allocations began to vest in small amounts since Solana's mainnet launch. One million Grant Pool tokens vested every three months for the first nine months, and 35 million Community Reserve tokens vested in 5 million token increments over the same timeframe.

After disclosing this information to SOL holders, the team opted to burn an equivalent amount of tokens from the foundation's allocation.\n\nOngoing Emissions\nSolana validators voted to enable <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/61adff26-b903-4ab9-8329-952d6a555228\">\"pico-inflation\"</a> on Dec. 24, 2020.

This relatively low inflation rate is only temporary and will be replaced by a more substantial and permanent inflation proposal at some point in 2021.\n\nThis \"final\" inflation proposal includes an initial annual inflation rate of 8%. However, this inflation rate will decrease at an annual rate of 15% (\"dis-inflation rate\"). Solana's inflation rate will continue to decrease until it reaches an annual rate of 1.5%, which the network should reach in about ten years or 2031. 1.5% will remain the long-term inflation rate for Solana unless the network's governance system votes to change it.", "general_emission_type": "Inflationary", "precise_emission_type": "Decreasing Inflation rate", "is_capped_supply": false, "max_supply": null}, "consensus": {"consensus_details": "Solana's Proof of Stake (PoS) based consensus mechanism, specifically called Tower BFT, leverages the network's Proof of History (PoH) technique as a clock before consensus to reduce communication overhead and latency.\n\nEach time a validator votes on a particular fork, voting is restricted to a fixed period of hashes called a slot. The current network setting has around 400 milliseconds (ms) for one slot. Every 400ms, the network has a potential rollback point, but every subsequent vote doubles the amount of time that the network would have to stall before it can unroll that vote. In short, secondary votes make it much harder to undo the transactions executed in a particular slot. Therefore, a block with several votes has a greater chance of remaining a part of the chain permanently.\n\nAs an example, each validator has voted 32 times in the last 12 seconds. The vote 12 seconds ago now will have a timeout of 2\u00b3\u00b2 slots or roughly 54 years. Effectively, this vote will never be rolled back by the network. Whereas the most recent vote has a timeout of two slots or about 800ms. As new blocks are added to the ledger, old blocks are increasingly likely to be confirmed because the number of slots old votes is committed to doubles every slot. Tower BTF offers finality once two-thirds of network validators have voted on some order of events. Once transactions are finalized, they can't be rolled back.\n\nThe Solana mainnet is planned to operate in delegated-Proof-of-Stake (dPoS), in which token holders can participate in the block production process and earn rewards by either stake token and become a validator themselves, or delegate their tokens to validators they trust.\n\nAny individual can become a validator on the network and contribute to the overall security of the protocol. There is no minimum staking requirement, although the leader selection process (which validator gets to propose the next block) is stake-weighted. The network architecture is designed to scale with bandwidth and hardware, utilizing GPU cores to parallelize execution and reduce verification times.

Proof of History is a high-frequency Verifiable Delay Function (VDF), which requires a specific number of sequential steps to evaluate but produces a unique output that can be publicly verified. This means that nodes can create the next block without having to coordinate with the entire network first because they can trust the timestamp and ordering of the messages that they\u2019ve received. The result is a reduction in consensus overhead.\n\nTower BFT: A PoH-optimized version of PBFT\nOn top of Proof of History, Solana runs its consensus mechanism called Tower BFT, which is a PBFT-like algorithm that leverages the synchronized clock enabled by PoH to achieve consensus on network transactions. At a high level, each time a node on the network votes on a particular fork, they commit to a certain amount of time where they are locked out from voting on an opposing fork. This period where they are locked out grows exponentially as they continue to vote on the same fork until they achieve a maximum lockout at 32 votes for the same fork. Nodes on the network will only receive inflation rewards when they reach this maximum vote lockout; therefore, it is in their interest to continue voting on the fork they believe the supermajority of the network is voting for.\n\nTurbine: A block propagation protocol\nSolana transmits blocks (communicates blocks between validators) independently of consensus, using a separate but connected protocol called Turbine. Turbine borrows heavily from BitTorrent and is optimized for streaming. As a block is streamed, it is broken up into small packets along with erasure codes, and then fanned out across a large set of random peers.\n\nGulf Stream: Mempool-less transaction forwarding protocol\nIn a high-performance network, mempool management presents a new class of problems when it comes to the cost of filtering and maintaining a rising number of unconfirmed transactions. Gulf Stream functions by pushing transaction caching and forwarding to the edge of the network. Since every validator knows the order of upcoming leaders (block producers) in Solana architecture, clients and validators forward transactions to the expected leader ahead of time. This allows validators to execute transactions ahead of time, reduce confirmation times, switch leaders faster, and reduce the memory pressure on validators from the unconfirmed transaction pool. One consequence of knowing leaders ahead of time is an increased risk of validator collusion since the network allows more time for them to coordinate. Solana's fast block times might mitigate the opportunity for collusion because it limits the time allowed to plan an attack. \n\nSealevel: Parallel smart contracts run-time\nSolana built Sealevel, a hyper parallelized transaction processing engine designed to scale horizontally across GPUs and SSDs. Most other blockchains are single-threaded computers. In contrast, Solana can support parallel transaction execution (in addition to signature verification) in a single shard. The solution to this problem borrows heavily from an operating system driver technique called scatter-gather. Transactions specify upfront what state they will read and write while executing. Sealevel is able to find the non-overlapping transactions occurring in a block and execute them in parallel (called parallel execution) while optimizing how read and writes to the state are scheduled across an array of RAID 0 SSDs. Sealevel is a VM that schedules transactions, but it doesn\u2019t actually execute transactions in the VM. Instead, Sealevel hands off transactions to be executed on hardware natively using bytecode called the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF).\n\nPipeline: A Transaction Processing Unit for validation optimization\nThe process of transaction validation on the Solana network makes extensive use of an optimization common in CPU design called pipelining. Pipelining is an appropriate process when there\u2019s a stream of input data that needs to be processed by a sequence of steps and there\u2019s different hardware responsible for each step. On the Solana network, the pipeline mechanism, the Transaction Processing Unit (TPU), progresses through Data Fetching at the kernel level, Signature Verification at the GPU level, Banking at the CPU level, and Writing at the kernel space. By the time the TPU starts to send blocks out to the validators, it\u2019s already fetched in the next set of packets, verified their signatures, and begun crediting tokens. The GPU parallelization in this four-stage pipeline allows the Solana TPU to operate at a high performance.\n\nCloudbreak: Horizontally-scaled accounts database\nMethods to scale computation using these other innovations could result in memory bottlenecks. Memory is used to keep track of accounts and can struggle to maintain performance due to a lack of memory size and limited access speeds. Cloudbreak was designed to optimize for concurrent reads and writes spread across a RAID 0 configuration of SSDs. Each additional disk adds storage capacity available to on-chain programs, while also increasing the number of concurrent reads and writes programs can perform when executing. This goes hand in hand with Solana\u2019s transaction design, allowing for pre-fetching accounts from disk and preparing the runtime for execution, also enabling nodes on the network to begin executing transactions before they are encoded into a block. All of this aims to help reduces block times and confirmation latency on the network.\n\nArchivers: Distributed ledger storage\nStoring and maintaining data on a high-performance network is likely to become a primary centralization vector. If storage costs are very high, only well-funded entities will be able to act as validators and participate in consensus. On Solana, data storage is offloaded from validators to a network of nodes called Archivers. Archivers do not participate in consensus. The history of the state is broken into many pieces and erasure codes. Archivers store small parts of the state. Every so often, the network will ask the Archivers to prove that they\u2019re storing the data they are supposed to. Solana leverages Proofs of Replication (PoRep), which are borrowed heavily from Filecoin. Archivers are not currently implemented and are on the long term roadmap. They will be rolled out based on network data demands.", "client_repositories": [{"name": "Solana", "link": "https://github.com/solana-labs/solana", "license_type": "Apache-2.0"}]}, "security": {"audits": [{"title": "Architectural Security Review", "date": "2019-10-15T00:00:00Z", "type": "Security", "details": "Kudelski Security, the cybersecurity division of the Kudelski Group, performed an architectural security evaluation of the core Solana platform.

Polkadot refers to the entire ecosystem of parachains that plug into a single base platform known as the Relay Chain.

Dr. Wood started working on his idea to \u201cdesign a sharded version of Ethereum\u201d in mid-2016 and released the first draft of the Polkadot white paper in Oct. 2016.\n\nIn 2017, Dr. Wood and Parity\u2019s Peter Czaban founded the Web3 Foundation, a non-profit entity established to support the research and development of Polkadot as well as to oversee its fundraising efforts. The Switzerland-based Web3 Foundation hosted Polkadot\u2019s first token sale in Oct. 2017, using a Spend-All Second Price Dutch Auction to distribute the funds. The sale raised $145 million in just under two weeks, selling 50% of the initial 10 million DOT (old) supply, and the Web3 Foundation chose Parity Technologies to develop Polkadot.\n\nParity Technologies was founded by Dr. Wood and Jutta Steiner and is known for maintaining the Parity Ethereum client in addition to Substrate, which serves as the development framework for Polkadot.\n\nParity Wallet hack and subsequent fundraising efforts\nTen days after the token sale ended (Nov. 6, 2017), someone permanently froze the funds in the Parity multisig contract (the second such incident in a matter of months) compromising a little over $90 million worth of ETH equaling around 66% of Polkadot\u2019s token sale proceeds. Polkadot, along with Parity, has petitioned the Ethereum community to consider finding a way to return to the funds, but the situation remains unresolved. Despite the lost funds, Polkadot and Web3 Foundation reported the project still had enough funds to meet its development milestones.\n\nThe Web3 Foundation reportedly raised more capital to replenish the lost funds in a 2019 private token sale. In the sale, Polkadot sought to sell 500,000 DOT (old) tokens at a $1.2 billion valuation, pricing the tokens at $120 apiece. Although the foundation did not disclose any details related to the raise, it was reported that the sale closed in June 2019 at a \u201csuccessful\u201d valuation.\n\nPolkadot technical developments and mainnet rollout\nOn the technical front, Polkadot started rolling out various proofs-of-concept (PoCs) in May 2018 to test its base relay chain, the relay chain\u2019s support for parachains, and its finality agent (dubbed GRANDPA). PoC 3, released in Jan. 2019, also introduced the Alexander testnet, Polkadot\u2019s first test network. But the project\u2019s first significant release came in Aug. 2019 with the public launch of Kusama. Kusama is an early, unaudited, and unrefined release of Polkadot, designed to serve as a \"canary\" network for Polkadot to test governance, staking, and sharding under real economic conditions. Polkadot also dedicated 1% of the initial DOT supply to Kusama stakeholders in order to encourage participation.\n\nPolkadot adopted a staged rollout strategy for its mainnet launch. Polkadot's first mainnet chain candidate, Phase 1, launched on <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/polkadot-goes-live-with-the-release-of-its-first-mainnet-chain-candidate\">May 27, 2020</a>. It marked the initial step in a multi-stage rollout process detailed in the project's mainnet launch roadmap. This early version of Polkadot operated as Proof-of-Authority (PoA) network managed by six validators belonging to the Web3 Foundation. Eventually, the network transitioned to its proposed Nominated Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system on Jun. 18, 2020 (Phase 2), which enabled DOT owners to claim validators slots and unlocked staking rewards. Phases 3 and 4 in late Jul. 2020 introduced Polkadot's governance functionality and handing control of the protocol over to the community, respectively. The final phase plans to unlock DOT token transfers on Aug. 18, 2020.\n\nThe Web3 Foundation continues to use the proceeds from DOT sales to fund ecosystem initiatives and back projects building on Polkadot (see: the <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/polychain-web3-foundation-start-a-fund-to-back-projects-building-on-polkadot\">Polkadot Ecosystem Fund</a>). The foundation is governed by the Foundation Council, a governing body consisting of Dr. Gavin Wood (President and Founder), Dr. Aeron Buchanan (Vice President), and Reto Trinkler.\n\nDOT redenomination\nIn the first official community vote for the network, Polkadot token holders voted to change the denomination between DOT and its smallest unit, Plancks, by a factor of 100. This change officially went into effect at block #1,248,328, which arrived on Aug. 21, 2020, about 72 hours after DOT transfers unlocked at block #1,205,128  (Aug. 18, 2020).\n\nIt was a cosmetic change that was similar to a stock split. The token balances of each Polkadot account increased by 100x, increasing the total DOT supply from its original 10 million to 1 billion. But the move did not impact Polkadot\u2019s pre-market valuation as the dollar amount of each DOT will decrease by 100x.", "issuing_organizations": [{"slug": "web3-foundation", "name": "Web3 Foundation", "logo": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1559174400%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3D-jE_laEyeDh1GYOUNMx-smbk2ioFJPSawQAq4o97Vts", "description": "The Web3 Foundation was created to nurture and steward technologies and applications in the fields of decentralised web software protocols, particularly those which utilize modern cryptographic methods to safeguard decentralisation, to the benefit and for the stability of the Web3 ecosystem."}]}, "roadmap": [{"title": "Proof of Concept (PoC) 1", "date": "2018-05-18T04:00:00Z", "type": "Software Release", "details": "Initial proof of concept that included basic state transition engine for relay chain and on-chain governance"}, {"title": "Proof of Concept (PoC) 2 ", "date": "2018-07-17T04:00:00Z", "type": "Software Release", "details": "The second PoC includes support for parachains, rewards and slashing to PoS consensus algorithms, testnet: \"Krumme Lanke\", and its first automatic upgrade via governance"}, {"title": "BBQ-Birch testnet", "date": "2018-10-05T04:00:00Z", "type": "Testnet Launch", "details": "BBQ-Birch testtnet is a WASM smart contracts chain built with Substrate"}, {"title": "Proof of Concept (PoC) 3", "date": "2019-01-21T05:00:00Z", "type": "Testnet Launch", "details": "The third PoC introduced the GRANDPA finality gadget and added the Alexander testnet."}, {"title": "Proof of Concept (PoC) 4", "date": "2019-05-20T04:00:00Z", "type": "Software Release", "details": "The fourth PoC, implemented as a run-time upgrade for the Alexander testnet, added new staking features to help make running a validator more secure and made changes to GRANDPA optimizations."}, {"title": "Kusama Chain Candidate 1 (CC1)", "date": "2019-08-23T04:00:00Z", "type": "Canary Network Launch", "details": "Kusama is an early, unaudited and unrefined release of Polkadot.

It serves four functions: payment for fees, governance over the network, interoperability, and bonding. When messages are sent between two blockchains on the network, DOT's are used to pay for fees. DOT holders are also responsible for managing significant events by voting on protocol upgrades and fixes. The token also ensures that network participants act in a manner that does not damage the network by giving them skin in the game. In order to create new parachains, tokens must be bonded ensuring incentive alignment.\n\nHow to stake DOTs\nWhile validators on Polkadot need to maintain the (often expensive) hardware necessary to secure the network, anyone can assume the role of a nominator by bonding their DOTs to a dedicated validator. Bonding tokens helps increase the network\u2019s cost of attack and allows DOT holders to earn newly minted tokens as staking rewards. Polkadot is targeting about a 75% stake rate, which at a 10% inflation rate in the network\u2019s inaugural year, would provide an annual staking return of~20%. Bonded tokens will remain locked for twelve weeks and are subject to slashing (loss of funds) should the chosen validator go offline or misbehave.\n\nPolkadot Wallet\nThere are multiple teams working on Polkadot wallet implementations prior to network launch.

Participants were required to use a KYC system called PICOPS, which verifies the identity of each participant. Participants that were unable to verify themselves were deemed ineligible. The sale was also not available to any Chinese or American citizens due to regulatory concerns. \n\nAt the start of the network, a total of 10 million DOT (old) will be created as a native token. The initial supply was later redenominated by a community vote, a cosmetic change that increased token account balances by 100x. The following allocations are the same for both DOT (old) and new DOT:\n\n50% allocated to token sale investors\n5% allocated to the 2019 private sale investors\n3.4% allocated to 2020 token sale investors\n11.6% retained by the Foundation for future fundraising efforts\n30% allocated to the Web 3 Foundation for immediate use to develop the Polkadot network and other undisclosed Foundation activities.\n\nThe total supply is not fixed at 1 billion but instead will use a to be determined inflationary model to supply the rewards for the proof-of-stake (<a href=\"https://messari.io/article/proof-of-stake\">PoS</a>) system. \n\nOn Nov. 6, 2017, a vulnerability was exploited in the Parity multi-sig wallet containing over 500,000 ETH, including $98 million of the $140 million+ in ETH raised through the Polkadot ICO. These funds are currently frozen, and a debate among the Ethereum community will determine whether these funds can or will ever be recovered. Even if the funds are lost, the Parity team does not believe this will impact their development roadmap.\n\nIn Jun. 2019, The Web3 Foundation announced it sold another 500,000 DOT (old) tokens (now 50 million new DOT) to an undisclosed group of private investors.

At a high level, Polkadot allows the network to produce blocks at a rapid pace while permitting the slower finality agent to run in a separate process, thereby not affecting transaction execution times. This design theoretically helps overcome the issues associated with probabilistic finality, namely the chance of unknowingly following an incorrect fork or the inability to produce new blocks (aka stalling).\n\nThe two mechanisms that power Polkadot\u2019s consensus include:\nBABE: The Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension (BABE) is the block production mechanism. It assigns block production slots to randomly selected validators according to stake (as defined by the Polkadot randomness cycle).\nGRANDPA: The GHOST-based Recursive ANcestor Deriving Prefix Agreement (GRANDPA) is the finality gadget for the Polkadot relay chain. This agent reaches agreements on chains rather than blocks, which could speed up the finalization process. Polkadot helps elaborate on this definition by stating if \u201cmore than 2/3 of validators attest to a chain containing a certain block, all blocks leading up to that one are finalized at once.\u201d\n\nWhile the core technology of Polkadot is the relay chain, the network reaches consensus through a modified and proprietary PoS mechanism consisting of four key participants: collators, validators, nominators, and fishermen.\n\nCollator\nEach parachain has a collator that fulfills the task of a miner in a <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/proof-of-work\">proof-of-work</a> (PoW) blockchain. A collator must maintain the Polkadot relay chain state as well as the state of the parachain. The collator then manages the queue of transactions going into and out of the parachain from the relay chain. Collators collect parachain transactions, produce state transition proofs, create new candidate blocks and then pass them along to validators in exchange for a fee for their work. In a competitive market with many collators, collators can incentivize validators to choose their block by sharing a portion of their fee with the validator.\n\nValidators\nValidators are randomly nominated to accept block candidates from parachain collators, verify the information in the block, and republish the block candidate to the Polkadot relay chain. Once a validator confirms a block, they also validate and change the state of the relay chain block by moving the transaction data from the originating parachain\u2019s input queue to the destination parachain\u2019s output queue. Validators are incentivized through a staking mechanism that requires them to stake Polkadot (DOT) tokens to the network to be chosen as an active validator. Validators that break the consensus algorithm are punished by losing a portion of their stake, while those that correctly secure the network and verify blocks are rewarded with new tokens.\n\nNominators\nNominators are those who may be unable to participate in the transaction validation process directly, so they instead contribute tokens to a validator of their choice. Nominators receive a pro-rata share of the validator reward based on their portion of the validator\u2019s bond, so nominators are incentivized to choose a validator most likely to receive the largest reward. The team believes the nominator process will create a competitive, but honest, marketplace for high-quality validators and nominators.\n\nFishermen\nFishermen do not participate in the transaction validation process with validators and nominators, but instead, act as watchmen monitoring activity across the Polkadot network and identify validators who break consensus rules. Fishermen stake a smaller bond of tokens than a validator but receive a proportionally larger reward than validators for their role in securing the network.", "general_consensus_mechanism": "Proof-of-Stake", "precise_consensus_mechanism": "Nominated Proof-of-Stake", "targeted_block_time": null, "block_reward": null, "mining_algorithm": null, "next_halving_date": null, "is_victim_of_51_percent_attack": null}}, "native_treasury": {"accounts": [], "treasury_usage_details": null}}, "technology": {"overview": {"technology_details": "Polkadot features a variety of technical components, including the relay-chain, parachains, the Polkadot Runtime Environment (PRE), and cross-network bridges.\n\nRelay-chain\nPolkadot's relay-chain is built with Substrate, a blockchain building framework that is the distillation of Parity technologies learnings building Ethereum, Bitcoin, and enterprise blockchains. It is at the core of the network, helping map addresses to account information, coordinating communications, and providing consensus through a pooled security mechanism utilizing proof-of-stake (PoS). All validators stake their DOTs and produced blocks directly on the relay-chain.\n\nThe relay chain lacks features like smart contracts and instead is designed to be a minimal protocol to connect other network participants and provide transaction finality. Since this central chain is handling the bulk of the network\u2019s transaction flows, actions on the relay-chain may come at a premium. But the relay-chain will delegate a significant portion of the computational work to the surrounding parachains, which can have \u201cdiffering implementations and features.\u201d\n\nParachains\nParachains will be used to collect and process transactions while using the relay chain for finality. To increase transaction throughput, parachains will process transactions concurrently across multiple chains, instead of queuing transactions and processing them sequentially.\n\nPolkadot does not place any constraints on the design and structure of parachains. These network components can be application-specific or support a particular feature (e.g., privacy or scalability). But each parachain must generate a proof regularly so a designated Polkadot validator can verify and reconcile past transactions. Parachains also share the same state as the relay-chain, meaning if the relay-chain should revert at any point, then all parachains would revert as well. In terms of composability, cross-parachain communication is native to Polkadot. Therefore, parachains will be able to send messages (including transactions and data) to each other \u201cwithout the need for smart contracts to perform the bridging functionality.\u201d\n\nPolkadot Runtime Environment (PRE)\nThe PRE consists of the networking, consensus and WebAssembly Virtual Machine subsystems. Polkadot breaks the components of the PRE down to:\nNetwork Interactions\nState storage and the Storage Trie\nConsensus Engine\nWasm Virtual Machine (VM)\n\nPolkadot\u2019s state machine is compiled to WebAssembly (WASM), a high-performance virtual environment. WASM is developed by major companies including Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla, that have created a large ecosystem of support for the standard. Polkadot's networking uses libp2p, a cross-platform network framework for peer-to-peer applications that handles the peer discovery and communication in the Polkadot ecosystem. The Polkadot runtime environment is being coded in C++, and Golang to make Polkadot accessible to a wider range of developers.\n\nBridging\nPolkadot will eventually enable the connections to outside networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin through a series of specialized bridge contracts or modules. There are two different types of external bridging in Polkadot:\nBridge contracts: Smart contracts that connect Polkadot\u2019s relay-chain to external chains (for example, the Parity Bridge between an Ethereum Proof-of-Authority (<a href=\"https://messari.io/article/proof-of-authority\">PoA</a>) sidechain to a Substrate-based chain)\nIn-built bridging modules: Purpose-built modules that help external chains connect with Polkadot", "client_repositories": []}, "security": {"audits": [{"title": "Trail of Bits Parity Security Review", "date": "2018-08-31T04:00:00Z", "type": "Security", "details": "In August 2018, Trail of Bits [completed a security review](https://www.parity.io/parity-completes-trail-of-bits-security-review/) of Parity Ethereum, which shares core components with Substrate and Polkadot."}, {"title": "Security Audit of the Polkadot Claims Smart Contract", "date": "2019-07-26T04:00:00Z", "type": "Security", "details": "The [security audit of Polkadot Claims](https://www.trailofbits.com/reports/parity.pdf) was performed by Chain Security.

This system will allow active token holders and Council members to propose codebase changes by bonding a minimum amount of DOTs to the network to ensure some economic buy-in. Other token holders can also deposit an equivalent amount of tokens to the proposal to support it. The top proposals by stake amount are selected to be a referendum, which Polkadot defines as \u201cinclusive, stake-based voting schemes.\u201d Bonded tokens are returned once the proposal is brought to a vote. If the proposal originates within the Council, Council members can approve the raw submission internally and move the proposal to a referendum.\n\nEvery 30 days, a new referendum is brought to a vote, with separate queues for Council and public submissions. To vote, token holders must lock up their tokens \u201cfor at least the enactment delay period,\u201d which could stretch beyond the end of the referendum, to ensure economic buy-in and discourage vote selling.\n\nWhat determines if the proposal passes the vote depends on which entity proposed the referendum. Polkadot references [three possible scenarios](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance#tallying):\n- If a public submission, Positive Turnout Bias (Super-Majority Approve)\n- If a Council submission that reaches a \u201cComplete agreement,\u201d Negative Turnout Bias (Super-Majority Against)\n- If a Council submission that reaches a \u201cMajority agreement,\u201d Simple Majority\n\nAt genesis, the [Council](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance#council) began with thirteen members, represented as on-chain accounts. There are plans to increase this total over the following nine months to a max of 24. DOT holders vote these representatives into their privileged positions via a network-wide election process. All members have a fixed term of one year, although any representative can be removed early via a referendum. Network participants rely on the Council for two primary tasks: proposing new referenda and canceling possibly malicious proposals. Members must reach a unanimous agreement to carry out a referendum cancellation.\n\nPolkadot also employs a [Technical Committee](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance#technical-committee), first introduced in the Kusama rollout, as one of the three chambers of its governance system. Committee representatives consist of teams that previously \u201cimplemented or specified either Polkadot/Kusama runtime or the runtime environment.\u201d The Council has the power to either add or remove Technical Committee teams by a simple majority vote. The committee\u2019s sole purpose is to produce emergency referenda in the event of a dire situation. These proposals get fast-tracked for Council voting and implementation.\n\nThis governance design is in practice at the moment on the Kusama network. Its upgrade to CC3 on Nov. 28, 2019, unlocked its on-chain governance capabilities, enabling stakeholders to submit and vote on potential code changes. Through this process, Kusama participants already increased the network validator count beyond its base level and unlocked KSM token transfers.\n\nSee Kusama referenda

Ripple enables banks, payment providers, digital asset exchanges, and corporations to send money globally using blockchain technology. Leveraging the prior work of <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/ryan-fugger\">Ryan Fugger</a>, in 2012 Ripple created the XRP Ledger (formerly known as Ripple Consensus Ledger), an open-source cryptographic ledger powered by a peer-to-peer network of nodes. XRP is the native asset of the XRP ledger.\n\nIn 2004, Ryan Fugger founded RipplePay, a financial technology company aiming to create a peer-to-peer payments network. Separately, in 2011, a team of Jed McCaleb began the development of a new consensus network for digital currencies that would ultimately become the XRP Ledger. Later Chris Larsen, <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/david-schwartz\">David Schwartz</a>, and Arthur Britto, would join the project, and in 2012 McCaleb and Larsen approached Ryan about RipplePay. After discussion with the RipplePay community Ryan handed over the project to McCaleb and Larsen, and in September 2012 they founded Opencoin (re-branded to Ripple Labs in 2013). \n\nIn 2013 Ripple released XRP, a native token on the Ripple Consensus Ledger. At launch, it created 100 billion XRP tokens of which 80 billion tokens were allocated to the company and 20 billion were given to the three founders. Over the course of 2013, Ripple would raise over $7.5 million from some of the most prestigious venture firms in the united states. Later that year Jed McCaleb would leave the company over internal disputes around the company's vision and would ultimately go on to found Stellar.\n\nAfter the initial release of the XRP Ledger, Ripple focused its efforts on getting financial institutions to use the ledger to process remittances. Entering the cross border payments market led to regulatory scrutiny, with FinCEN fining Ripple Inc for violating the bank secrecy act in 2015. As part of the remedial plan related to the fine, Ripple Inc agreed to enhance the anti-money laundering capabilities of the XRP protocol and stricter permissioning requirements were added for additional participants to join the network.\n\nTo further enhance the credibility of XRP as a partner for traditional financial institutions, Ripple obtained a <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/bitlicense\">BitLicense</a> from the State of New York in 2016. The upside of these enhancements and engagement with regulators was it gave XRP the capability to more deeply integrate with the traditional financial system. \n\nToday XRP's primary use is as a bridge currency underpinning <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ripple\">Ripple</a>'s xRapid product, an on-demand liquidity solution. xRapid allows financial institutions to exchange value between fiat currencies through a network a digital asset exchanges that use XRP as a bridge currency for its liquidity.\n\nTo date Ripple has raised over $120 million in venture funding, and XRP is one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the world by market capitalization. Ripple and its founding team own the substantial majority of the XRP supply of which Ripple the company programmatically sells on a quarterly basis.

XRP is burned to pay fees for transactions via Ripplenet. Nevertheless, XRP liquid and circulating supply are massively inflationary. \n\nIn December 2017, Ripple placed 55 billion XRP into escrow in order to alleviate concerns that a massive amount of XRP could hit the market all at once with substantial negative price impact. 1 billion is being released monthly to support Ripple\u2019s ongoing operation of Ripplenet. Any unused funds are returned to escrow at the end of the month. On average Ripple re-escrows 700 million and 300 million XRP become liquid each month.\n\nRipple generated revenue from ongoing XRP sales, which account for well over 90% of the company's revenue. There are two types of XRP sales that the company discloses:\nProgrammatic sales: These come from the company\u2019s XRP reserve, and can be sold at a rate of no more than 0.25% of average daily volume on defined exchanges. \nDirect sales from XRP II: These come from direct bespoke deals with institutional clients, and include (per Ripple\u2019s 2016-2017 disclosures) reselling restrictions to ensure its partners do not purchase XRP at a discount from the company and then immediately flood the market with sales.\n\nRipple has sold over 1.2 billion USD worth of XRP through Direct Sales and Programmatic Sales. \n\nOur liquid supply curve takes into account the Ripple Escrow mechanism as well as the Founder' selling agreement to calculate liquid supply. As such, even though XRP's outstanding supply is deflationary over time through fee-burning, circulating and liquid supply are massively inflationary due to escrow release, founder's distributions, and Ripple sales. At the current burn rate, it would take 20 years for the XRP Ledger to burn what is distributed by Ripple and its founders every day. \n\nTo date, Messari released to in-depth research on Ripple supply management:\n<a href=\"https://messari.io/article/xrp-market-cap-may-be-6-1-billion-overstated\">XRP Market Cap may be $6.1 billion overstated</a>\n<a href=\"https://messari.io/article/messari-research-circulating-supply-study-for-xrp\">Circulating Supply Study for XRP</a>", "general_emission_type": "Deflationary", "precise_emission_type": "Programmatic burn", "is_capped_supply": true, "max_supply": null}, "consensus": {"consensus_details": "The XRP Ledger is managed by an independent network of validators that constantly compare their transaction records.

Once initiated, XRP\u2019s pathfinding algorithm identifies the quickest least expensive way to complete the transaction. Generally, for the pathfinding algorithm to work optimally, a large number of market makers need to be operating on the network so sufficient liquidity is available to efficiently complete transactions.\n\nTo encourage the development of a robust ecosystem around the ledger, XRP maintains a variety of APIs to help nodes and other third parties interact with it based on the REST API standard.

The project was launched out of the insight that the industry needed a fiat-collateralized stablecoin with strong governance and transparency, in contrast to <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/tether\">Tether</a>. USDC attempts to solve these issues by publishing a monthly public attestation of 100% reserves of fiat tokens on CENTRE.io, and providing clear rules and guidelines for CENTRE members regarding USDC issuance and redemption. Furthermore to become an issuer within the CENTRE consortium members must follow key membership and operating rules which include licensing, compliance, technology & operations, accounting, and custody of fiat reserves.\n\nExchanges have been the primary users of USDC as an alternative to fiat currencies, outsourcing the need to maintain banking relationships.

The issuer then executes a series of commands with the CENTRE network to verify, mint, and validate fiat tokens pegged to the value of those deposited funds. The customer can then transfer those tokens elsewhere in order to use them. Redemption follows the reverse sequence: fiat tokens are burned when a customer visits an off-ramp such as a web application maintained by a licensed CENTRE issuing member.

Some of Palmer's friends encouraged him to create a real Dogecoin project, so he registered dogecoin.com and started working. Billy Markus saw the website and reached out to Palmer. Markus and Palmer thought Dogecoin would make the cryptocurrency space more palletable to newcomers since, as they built the protocol, Bitcoin was beleaguered by associations with Silk Road and dark web. Palmer exited the Dogecoin project and community in June 2014 by tweeting, \"Unsubshibing. Peace.\"\n\nUnlike a variety of other altcoins launched in 2013 and 2014, Dogecoin has proved itself surprisingly resilient to crypto-asset market cycles, which is speculated to be the result of meme durability.

digitally native assets that are price-stable against the world's major fiat currencies. Keeping in mind that previous innovations in the technology of money was bootstrapped by large payment networks (Alipay with Taobao, Paypal with eBay, Visa with banks), Terra was born with the support of the Terra Alliance, 15 large e-commerce companies in Asia that collectively process 25 billion USD in annualized transaction volume and 45 million users. The vision of the project is that with the adoption and user engagement of a massive payment network, it will be able to, for the first time, bootstrap a blockchain payment network to the scale it deserves and facilitate far more powerful products and use cases through its infrastructure.  \n\nDuring conversations between co-founders, Daniel Shin and Do Kwon, the concept of Terra began as a solution towards immediate and massive usage of the cryptocurrency and blockchain infrastructure being built around them. To them, price stability and adoption were important in preparing the first steps towards massive adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain infrastructure. Daniel Shin, with his extensive experience in building one of the biggest e-commerce platforms in Asia, laid out the existing problems we face in payment networks that cannot be solved through just incremental improvements. Do Kwon, previously a founder of a wireless mesh network startup building decentralized application, explained how Terra can turn those problems into an opportunity to build money from the ground up.  \n\nOne part of Terra's value contributions, payments, in essence replaces the complicated payments value chain, including credit card networks, banks, and payment gateways with a single blockchain layer. Through this, it can offer merchants a significantly cheaper transaction fee, saving them money that can be reinvested in something else. Further, in concert with the efficiencies that Terra has provided payment channels for both merchants and consumers, it continues to steadily provide infrastructural improvements and tools for the foundations of laying down a credibly neutral, distributed, and radically transparent ecosystem. Bolstered through the initial mass adoption of Terra's blockchain infrastructure powering its partner, CHAI, which has amassed over 1.3 million users to date, Terra moves naturally towards ecosystem building that offers competitive programmable payments, logistics, and infrastructure to power the plethora of industry that will be built on efficiency and scale.", "issuing_organizations": [{"slug": "terraform-labs", "name": "Terraform Labs", "logo": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/ext%3Fw%3D600%26h%3D600%26hash%3DaL0Z3WCt0kzzjTmuwZbAlt%252BzD3c%253D%26ora%3D1%252CaFBCTXdkRmpGL2lvQUFBPQ%252CxAVta5g-0R6rhAhLjBgo862OuF2j4QpEQYySAW_8RGbuq4vUMTW9eMfAPPL9-wxCOzNFxUZwLvD3Amm2S83td5XuFcNyjZDmIZK1N1cCb01m1WsevoI4PUkmtJHwVu6iNywYirQMOSvoa7vsKUIxDQ", "description": null}]}, "roadmap": [{"title": "Columbus-1", "date": "2019-04-23T04:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": "Mainnet launch.

Terraform Labs also holds an additional 4.5% of the LUNA supply on behalf of investors who did not clear KYC in time for their token sale, and thus manually claim tokens for Terraform Labs rather than having their tokens programmatically vest from the genesis block.\n\nEmployees & Contributor Pool (20%): Used to compensate employees and contributors of the project. Some part of the coins have already been granted, and can be found in the accounts/employees directory. Currently 4.7% of this pool has been granted.  \n\nTerra Alliance (20%): The Terra Alliance is key to driving early adoption and usage for Terra. We will be using this pool to set incentives, mainly marketing discount programs (such as coupons for users) and volume incentives for alliance partners. Terraform Labs will be playing custodian for this pool, taking input from the community to best allocate resources from this pool.  \n\nStability Reserves (20%): Bootstrapping stablecoins is no easy feat, with threats to the peg coming from every adversarial angle. Stability reserves will be to manage the network's early stability close to genesis.  \n\nGenesis liquidity (4%): 4% of Luna will be made available to the market close to genesis to allow everyday users to use and interact with it.\n\nInvestors (26%):  \n\nIn order to finance the development of the Terra Project, Terraform Labs held three token sales:  \n\nSeed-sale: 16 cents per Luna, sold ~192M tokens.

Core to Terra's stability mechanism is the swapping of stablecoins to Luna - and while this is effective in normal conditions, when there is large changes in stablecoin demand in either direction the cost for the swap increases significantly: swap fees increase quadratically as one side of the fee is favored (and normalizes back over time), so in times of rapid demand change the fee goes up significantly, which makes it difficult to accommodate payment operations requiring a very tight spread. During times like this Terraform Labs swaps SDT to KRT and sells that for KRW to Chai.

This is paid in any Terra currency, and is disbursed pro-rata to stake at the end of every block in TerraSDR.   \nSeigniorage rewards: Validators that participate in the Exchange Rate Oracle get a portion of seigniorage if they faithfully report and win the ballot (vote within the reward band around the weighted median).  \n\nBesides revenue, there are scarcity incentives:*   \n\nSwap fees: A small spread is charged on atomic swap transactions between Luna and any Terra currency, which is burned and creates scarcity in Luna and indirectly rewards validators. Note that validators can set commission on the fees their delegators receive as additional incentive.  \n\nIf validators double sign, are frequently offline or do not participate in governance, their staked Luna (including Luna of users that delegated to them) can be slashed.

If the system has detected that the price of a Terra currency has deviated from its peg, it must apply pressures to normalize the price. Like any other market, the Terra money market follows the simple rules of supply and demand for a pegged currency.\n\nTerra miners play a foundational role in the security and stability of Terra. They provide the former by participating in PoS consensus. They provide the latter by absorbing short-term volatility in Terra demand. Stable demand for mining is a core requirement for both security and stability. To achieve this, the protocol aims to offer stable and predictable rewards in all economic conditions, booms and busts alike. Rewards are seen via transaction fees and seigniorage (Luna burn).\n\nThe network emphasizes decentralized allocation of resources from its fiscal policy to support the development, continued growth, and steady income for decentralization applications (dApps) building on Terra. To receive this seigniorage from the Treasury, a dApp needs to register for consideration as an entity that operates on the Terra network. dApps are eligible for funding depending on their economic activity and use of funding.

For each module, you can find the parameters associated with it by browsing to the Parameters section of the module specification.  \n- The Community Pool Spend Proposal defines a special proposal that upon being passed, will disburse the coins specified in Amount to the Recipient account using funds from the Community Pool.  \n- The Tax Rate/Reward Update Proposal defines special proposals which allow the Tax Rate and Reward Weight values to be voted on and changed accordingly, subject to the policy constraints.  \n- Software Upgrade Proposals are for the moment considered unavailable, as they have not yet been implemented. They thus share the same semantics as a simple Text Proposal.", "is_treasury_decentralized": null}, "grants": []}, "metadata": {"updated_at": "2021-08-24T17:19:02Z"}}}, {"id":

A year later Hayden Adams began working on turning this idea into a functional product. After receiving several grants as well as $100,000 from the Ethereum Foundation, Uniswap launch in November 2018. The protocol quickly gained liquidity and started facilitating meaningful volume. Six months after launching, a fundraising round was <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/paradigm-backs-decentralized-exchange-protocol-uniswap\">completed</a>, led by Paradigm to allow the addition of two more employees.\n\nWhat makes Uniswap unique is that it solves the problem of high spreads for illiquid assets on order-book exchanges. This problem exists because there is little incentive for professional market makers to provide liquidity on very thinly traded assets. However, with Uniswap, anyone can be a market maker by depositing assets into a pool and earning fees based on the amount of trading activity. One downside to this model is that there is substantial slippage for large orders as the price paid increases as the quantity demanded increases.", "issuing_organizations": []}, "roadmap": [{"title": "Launch", "date": "2018-11-02T04:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": "Mainnet launch"}], "regulation": {"regulatory_details": null, "sfar_score": null, "sfar_summary": null}}, "contributors": {"individuals": [{"slug": "hayden-adams", "first_name": "Hayden", "last_name": "Adams", "title": "Founder of Uniswap Exchange", "description": null, "avatar_url": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/MUJLxUf8_400x400.jpg"}], "organizations": [{"slug": "ethereum-foundation", "name": "Ethereum Foundation", "logo": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/DOnqq1OM_400x400.jpg", "description": "Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference."}]}, "advisors": {"individuals": [], "organizations": []}, "investors": {"individuals": [], "organizations": [{"slug": "coinbase-ventures", "name": "Coinbase Ventures", "logo": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/HVEeWmV4_400x400.png", "description": "Coinbase Ventures invests in companies building the open financial system.

Unlike most other DEXs, there is no native token and every action occurs on-chain. Typically, exchanges function by using an order-book where market makers set the price at which they are willing to buy and sell an asset. The difference between these prices is how they get paid for this work. Uniswap does away entirely with the order book and instead opts to have market makers deposit assets into a pool that traders can then trade against. The price is determined algorithmically based on the proportion of the two assets being traded.\n\nPrice mechanism\nUniswap uses what's known as a Constant Product Market Maker that is designed to always provide liquidity regardless of the order size or amount of funds in the pool. This is achieved by asymptotically increasing the price as the size of the buy order increases, leading to potentially significant slippage on large orders. Trading pools consist of an ERC-20 token and an equivalent amount of ETH, with the product between the two sums remaining constant. Any given transaction increases one sum while decreasing the other and the price changes based on the ratio between the two. Users can also swap between two ERC-20 tokens, however, Uniswap will perform two separate actions with each of their respective pools.\n\nProviding liquidity\nWhen liquidity providers add to a pool, they receive newly minted liquidity tokens entitling them to their proportion of the total pool as well as the 0.3% fee generated off each trade. These tokens are not speculative and simply keep track of how much of the pool is owed. Liquidity providers need to supply both assets in the same proportion they are currently at, otherwise, they will change the ratio and thus price. This would result in the immediate loss of money as the price change should get arbitraged out by trading bots. Even if providers supply the correct ratio of each asset, large price changes can result in the loss of money. (Details on how this work can be found here). Therefore, providers are hoping for substantial volume of trading around the price they entered such that the fees generated account for any potential losses.", "client_repositories": []}, "security": {"audits": [{"title": "Uniswap Audit", "date": "2019-04-19T04:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": "ConsenSys diligence [performed](https://github.com/ConsenSys/Uniswap-audit-report-2018-12) a smart contract audit "}], "known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities": []}}, "governance": {"governance_details": "Uniswap does not have a mechanism to modify its existing contracts.

Chainlink's flexible architecture allows for highly configurable oracle networks that can be composed of any selection of node operators and data providers and that use different network parameters such as update frequency, fee payment amounts, and more.\n\nChainlink nodes are operated by professional DevOps infrastructure providers, leading enterprises, and premium data providers who supply smart contracts with access to cryptographically signed data for additional security guarantees. Because of its flexible design, Chainlink can provide any type of data or computation to any smart contract application operating on any blockchain network.", "client_repositories": [{"name": "Chainlink", "link": "https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink", "license_type": "MIT License"}, {"name": "ChainlinkClient", "link": "https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/evm-contracts/src/v0.7/ChainlinkClient.sol", "license_type": null}, {"name": "FluxAggregator", "link": "https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/evm-contracts/src/v0.6/FluxAggregator.sol", "license_type": null}, {"name": "VRF", "link": "https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/evm-contracts/src/v0.6/VRF.sol", "license_type": null}]}, "security": {"audits": [], "known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities": []}}, "governance": {"governance_details": null, "onchain_governance": {"onchain_governance_type": "No On-Chain Governance", "onchain_governance_details": null, "is_treasury_decentralized": false}, "grants": [{"funding_organizations": null, "grant_program_details": "The [Chainlink Community Grant Program](https://chain.link/community/grants) provides financial resources to the many development teams and researchers building a more functional, accessible, and socially impactful Chainlink Network.

Litecoin aimed to keep the best aspects of Bitcoin while making some optimizations for its use as a medium of exchange.\n\nNotably, Litecoin implements 2.5 minute block times and an 84 million max supply. Charlie Lee's original thinking was that quicker block confirmations would increase transaction throughput and reduce the amount of time merchants would need for block confirmations. Additionally, he thought the 84 million max supply would prevent the coin from becoming too scarce and expensive. Litecoin uses Scrypt, a memory intensive hashing algorithm, in order to better allow individuals to mine Litecoin with commodity hardware (although <a href=\"https://messari.io/blog/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics\">ASICs</a> have been developed for Litecoin mining over the past few years). Finally, Charlie Lee, recognizing the mistakes of the few altcoins launched prior to Litecoin, wanted Litecoin to be launched in a fair manner, electing to only do a 150 coin (3 block) premine to allow people to get in early.\n\nCharlie Lee left Coinbase in June 2017 to head the <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/litecoin-foundation\">Litecoin foundation</a>, which stewards the Litecoin project, and finances Litecoin Core development.

With offices in New York, London and Singapore, Paxos takes a global view of modernizing the financial system.\n"}]}, "roadmap": [], "regulation": {"regulatory_details": null, "sfar_score": null, "sfar_summary": null}}, "contributors": {"individuals": [], "organizations": [{"slug": "binance-holdings-ltd", "name": "Binance", "logo": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/unPh61IX_400x400.jpg", "description": "Binance is a digital asset exchange ecosystem offering a variety of centralized and decentralized products and services for efficiently buying and selling blockchain-based coins and tokens. \n"}]}, "advisors": {"individuals": [], "organizations": []}, "investors": {"individuals": [], "organizations": [{"slug": "cmt-digital", "name": "CMT Digital", "logo": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D2159024400%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DrmojjBVrRGFNvUwX6VIVToAjU4CUJgeytYCuAUk2HU8", "description": "CMT Digital, a division of the CMT Group, is focused on crypto asset trading, blockchain technology investments, and legal/policy engagement in the crypto asset / blockchain technology industry.

The requests for purchase and redemption of BUSD results in movement of cash in and out of the reserve, which in turn has the supplyController address mint and burn tokens accordingly. For example, purchase of $100 will result in issuance of 100 BUSD tokens and $100 being deposited into the reserve. On the other hand, redemption of 100 BUSD tokens results in destruction of those 100 tokens and withdrawal of $100 from the reserve to be given to the redeemer. As a resort to critical security threat, Paxos can pause transfer and approval of BUSD tokens via OpenZeppelin\u2019s contracts.\n\nAlthough the creation and destruction of the tokens occur through Paxos, other transactions in BUSD follow ERC-20 smart contracts. This ensures security for BUSD, as it gets rid of the need for third parties and instead relies on the long-tested global blockchain network. Additionally, trading tokens is simple with BUSD because viewing and transferring of BUSD is automatically supported by most Ethereum-supporting exchanges and wallet applications.\n\nDue to the Trust Charter, the New York State Department of Financial Services regulates and monitors the company and its operating procedures to make sure it follows New York banking laws. These banking laws also requires Paxos to have the power to freeze accounts as well as wipe the balance of said frozen accounts. BUSD has a function called \u201csetLawEnforcementRole.\u201d As its name implies, it can give administrative permissions over the circulating BUSD supply. Paxos has assured that the function is for preventing illegal activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing and that it will not be used unless required by law.", "client_repositories": []}, "security": {"audits": [], "known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities": []}}, "governance": {"governance_details": "Paxos is the sole entity capable of altering the circulating supply of BUSD tokens.

Paxos publishes monthly reports proving the US dollar reserves that back the BUSD tokens in circulation.\n\nMonthly Attestations", "onchain_governance": {"onchain_governance_type": null,

Traditional blockchains face high latency and transaction costs that can hamper their progress towards adoption, technological efficiency, and user experience. Layer-2 scaling solutions or external networks can act as load balances for networks that can't inherently scale as user activity increases.\n\nIn 2017, Plasma was at the forefront of blockchain scaling, and Matic featured a plasma-driven scaling approach and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) sidechains to assist Ethereum as user demand for the network grew. Over time, Matic POS became a prominent scaling option for various applications.\n\nMatic rebranded to Polygon in February 2021 to become a Swiss Army knife for scaling solutions. Polygon plans to add support for rollups and Validium to its already-existing Plasma/POS chain. The project recognizes that Ethereum may not scale from a single solution in isolation. There's a possibility that several solutions will co-exist and help scale Ethereum collectively, and Polygon aims to play a central role in supplying the infrastructure necessary to launch any of these systems.", "issuing_organizations": []}, "roadmap": [], "regulation": {"regulatory_details": null, "sfar_score": null, "sfar_summary": null}}, "contributors": {"individuals": [{"slug": "anurag-arjun", "first_name": "Anurag", "last_name": "Arjun", "title": "Co-Founder & CPO at Polygon", "description": null, "avatar_url": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/9E5D22B5-Anurag-Arjun.jpg"}, {"slug": "sandeep-nailwal", "first_name": "Sandeep", "last_name": "Nailwal", "title": "Co-Founder & COO at Polygon", "description": null, "avatar_url": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/BB5A9267-Sandeep-Nailwal.jpg"}, {"slug": "jayant-kanani", "first_name": "Jayant", "last_name": "Kanani", "title": "Co-Founder & CEO at Polygon", "description": null, "avatar_url": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/86E5FF2C-Jaynti-Kanani.jpg"}, {"slug": "mihailo-bjelic-2", "first_name": "Mihailo", "last_name": "Bjelic", "title": "Co-Founder at Polygon", "description": null, "avatar_url": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/760FF514-Mihailo-Bjelic.jpg"}], "organizations": [{"slug": "matic-network", "name": "Matic Network ", "logo": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/06942996-201825664W.png", "description": null}]}, "advisors": {"individuals": [{"slug": "john-lilic", "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Lilic", "title": "Strategy and Operations Lead at ConsenSys", "description": null, "avatar_url": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/8peZ8dx8_400x400.jpg"}, {"slug": "antony-sassaon", "first_name": "Anthony", "last_name": "Sassano", "title": "Co-founder of EthHub", "description": null, "avatar_url": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/gONuZhnK_400x400.png"}, {"slug": "ryan-sean-adams", "first_name": "Ryan", "last_name": "Sean Adams", "title": "Founder of Mythos Capital", "description": null, "avatar_url": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1555545600%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DNXQrwfzC2l5U8G7wTTVnPEND5gCO6dgwcdKMNdk7SVI"}, {"slug": "hudson-jameson", "first_name": "Hudson", "last_name": "Jameson", "title": "COO and Blockchain Lead at Oaken Innovations", "description": null, "avatar_url": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1555545600%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DhbL51X07mHLsiwKf3d_SP6kpuELzhp1qlsVbnAnRMX8"}], "organizations": []}, "investors": {"individuals": [], "organizations": [{"slug": "coinbase-ventures", "name": "Coinbase Ventures", "logo": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/HVEeWmV4_400x400.png", "description": "Coinbase Ventures invests in companies building the open financial system.

However, discussions around the block limit largely stayed in the background until 2017 when tensions within the Bitcoin community rose over rising transaction fees and increasingly divergent opinions on scaling Bitcoin. Supporters of bigger blocks believed that for Bitcoin to fulfill the vision of a peer-to-peer electronic currency as outlined in the original whitepaper, it was crucial to raise the block limit in order to increase transaction capacity. Bitcoin Cash proponents pushed for a system that could scale to VISA level transaction throughput without second layers and while maintaining affordable transaction fees. It rejected the philosophy of Bitcoin Core that Bitcoin's central value proposition is censorship resistance and trust-minimization, and that Bitcoin full nodes needed to be maximally decentralized to achieve this. Instead of envisioning Bitcoin as a settlement layer or a Digital Gold, Bitcoin Cash envisions Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, emphasizing Bitcoin's utility as a medium of exchange.\n\nIn 2017 at the Consensus conference amidst rising transaction fees on Bitcoin and increasingly tense debate around the Bitcoin block limit, a meeting with miners and Core Developers took place in what is referred to as the \u201cNew York Agreement\u201d, where an agreement was reached to support <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/segregated-witness\">SegWit</a> and a 2MB <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/hard-fork\">hard fork</a>. Known as SegWit2x, this proposal was backed by over 80% of the network\u2019s hash rate. Despite the desires of miners, users wanted to activate SegWit without the block size increase. They set a date (August 1, 2017) where Bitcoin would <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/soft-fork\">soft fork</a> to support SegWit and keep the 1MB block size. Enough nodes signaled support for it that they forced miners to accept or have their blocks rejected by the network. A faction of the bigger blocks camp, rejected SegWit altogether, citing frustrations with the prioritization of SegWit over bigger blocks, and on August 1, 2017 they launched a hard fork of Bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash, with 8MB block limits. The 8MB block limit was later increased to 32MB in 2018 after another contentious hard fork regarding a minority faction's desire to raise the block limit to 128MB. This hard fork resulted in the creation of Bitcoin SV, a fork of Bitcoin Cash. \n\nAlthough increased block capacity could increase transaction throughput on-chain, it could potentially restrict the universe of participants who could be capable of running full <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/node\">nodes</a>, thus making this something the community needs to address in order to be able to execute on its vision of a decentralized peer-to-peer cash system. In addition to pursuing on-chain scalability through larger block sizes, Bitcoin Cash prioritizes fast-paced development of technological improvements in opposition to the more conservative philosophy of Bitcoin. To date, Bitcoin Cash has 6 competing node implementations: BitcoinABC, Bitcoin Unlimited, BXT, Parity, Bitprim, and Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash has also had a variety of upgrades, the most recent of which taking place of 05/15/2021.

As such, it went through two halvings to date; in November 2012, and again in July 2016, each cutting the initial block reward by half. On average, Bitcoin Cash generates new blocks every 10 minutes, rewarding miners with 12.5 new BCH and the total transaction fees from the preceding block. Each block has a 32MB limit and block rewards are <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/halving\">halved </a>every 210,000 blocks (approximately 4 years). Eventually, once the 21 million BCH hard cap has been reached, block rewards will transition entirely to transaction fees shifting the security model of the protocol to one based on demand for block space versus one based on demand for BCH. Bitcoin Cash's next halving is expected to happen in May 2020.\n\nThe difference between BCH and BTC supply curves since the fork can be explained by the difficulty adjustment algorithm which included one addition compared to Bitcoin: the Emergency Difficulty Adjustment (EDA). This mechanism was set by the Bitcoin Cash developers to incentivize miners to prioritize BCH\u2019s transactions over that of BTC\u2019s. Miners leveraged this mechanism to maximize their profit by reducing their BCH mining output while waiting for the Emergency Difficulty Adjustment to reduce BCH\u2019s dif\ufb01culty, which in turn would lead to higher returns. As a result, 120,000 more BCH than BTC were mined from August 01, 2017, until November 13, 2017, when Bitcoin Cash underwent a hard fork to change the difficulty adjustment algorithm. \n\n", "general_emission_type": "Inflationary", "precise_emission_type": "Decreasing Issuance", "is_capped_supply": true, "max_supply": 20999999.9769}, "consensus": {"consensus_details": "Consensus\n\nBitcoin Cash uses <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/nakamoto-consensus\">Nakamoto Consensus</a> whereby the valid chain is the longest chain with the most accumulated <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\">proof-of-work</a>.

To bypass the hindrances such as limited performance and ad hoc governance that inherently exist in PoW chains, Cosmos was envisioned as a decentralized network of independent, scalable, and interoperable PoS blockchains. The ideal solution, according to Cosmos, was a tool for interacting with multiple parallel blockchains such that the unique value proposed by a chain can be expanded to any other chain.\nThe idea of a Proof-of-Stake blockchain with Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism originates from the year 2014 when the future Tendermint Inc. co-founder Jae Kwon explored the possibilities in his\u00a0research. With the participation of Ethan Buchman, the other Tendermint Inc. co-founder, this idea was further developed in 2015, and Cosmos was introduced to the public in 2016. Tendermint Inc. and Interchain Foundation (ICF) have been responsible for the development and adoption of the technologies underlying the Cosmos network, Tendermint Core \u2014a BFT consensus mechanism, and Cosmos SDK \u2014a developer-friendly modular framework for building blockchains.\nICF ran a successful initial coin offering for ATOM in 2017 and used the collected funds to boost the development of Cosmos SDK, IBC, and Peggy.

Any user can submit proposals on protocol upgrades, modifications to network parameters, bounty allocations, and other governance policies and participate in discussions on the Cosmos governance forum. Since community governance plays an essential role in the development and stability of the network, Cosmos Hub obliges each validator to vote on every proposal. Those who do not vote, get penalized by the protocol and their validator status gets deactivated for a predetermined period of time. The Cosmos Hub also benefits from an additional aiding agent named Governance Working Group which aims to equip Cosmos governance with structural tools, improve governance functionality, and conduct educational efforts to further the awareness and the adoption of Cosmos governance.", "onchain_governance": {"onchain_governance_type": "Delegated On-Chain Vote", "onchain_governance_details": "Proposals go through four different phases\u00a0before either being accepted and executed or rejected.\n\n__Phase 1: The Deposit Period__\u00a0\nAnyone can submit a text proposal to the system, but the proposal needs to be backed with a minimum deposit of\u00a0[64 ATOM](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/47)s within two weeks after the submission date to proceed into the voting phase.  This requirement is a protective measure against proposal spamming.  The party submitting the proposal does not necessarily need to provide the deposit themselves, or in other words, any ATOM holder can contribute to this deposit to support the proposal. Contributors can reclaim their tokens once the proposal gets accepted or if it fails to reach the minimum threshold after two weeks.\n\n__Phase 2: The Voting Period__\u00a0\nThe deposit period ends once the proposal reaches the minimum deposit amount and a two-week-long voting period begins. There are four voting options (\u201cYes\u201d, \u201cNo\u201d, \u201cNo with Veto\u201d, \u201cAbstain\u201d). During the voting process;\n- Only staked (bonded) tokens can participate in governance.\n- Voting power is measured in terms of stake. The amount of ATOMs staked determines the direct influence of the user on the decision-making process (coin voting).\n- Delegators inherit the vote of the validators they are delegated to unless they individually cast their vote, which will overwrite validator decisions.\n__Phase 3: Tallying Results__\u00a0\nFollowing requirements need to be satisfied for a proposal to get a passing vote:\n- __Quorum__: More than 40% of the total staked tokens need to have participated in the vote.\n- __Threshold__: More than 50% of the tokens that participated in the vote (after excluding \u201cAbstain\u201d votes) need to have voted in favor of the proposal (\u201cYes\u201d).\n- __Veto__: The number of votes cast for \"No with Veto\" shouldn't be greater than 33.4% of the tokens that participated (after excluding \u201cAbstain\u201d votes).\nThe proposal gets rejected if one of these requirements is not met at the end of the voting period. And if a proposal fails to pass the vote for any reason, the deposited tokens associated with the submission are not refunded and instead transferred to the community pool.\n\n__Phase 4: Implementing the Proposal__\u00a0\nAccepted proposals regarding protocol upgrades and network parameter modifications are integrated with a new version of Cosmos. Proposals regarding fund allocation, marketing activities, or any other decision that needs to be executed off-chain require additional operational management from the community.\n\n[List of current and part proposals](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals)", "is_treasury_decentralized": false}, "grants": [{"funding_organizations": [{"slug": null, "name": "Interchain Foundation", "logo": "https://res.cloudinary.com/crunchbase-production/image/upload/c_lpad,h_170,w_170,f_auto,b_white,q_auto:eco,dpr_1/tmrys9xfh7wmfodewc7l", "description": null}, {"slug": null, "name": "Tendermint Inc.", "logo": "https://res.cloudinary.com/crunchbase-production/image/upload/c_lpad,h_170,w_170,f_auto,b_white,q_auto:eco,dpr_1/v1477918485/ftxkhvkz2dofkxv1toa6.jpg", "description": null}], "grant_program_details": "ICF offers microgrants to external builders and technical contributors meanwhile Tendermint funds the community efforts within the scope of event hostings and marketing activities.

VeChain plans to develop Thor smart contract development with visualization tools and support for multiple languages.\n\nVeChain IDs are a key component of the VeChain blockchain. Physical good tracked with VeChain are assigned digital identities created with a SHA256 hash and tracked with NFC, RFID, and QR codes. \n\nVeChain uses a Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism that relies on masternodes to validate transactions. Authoritative masternodes are selected by the VeChain Foundation and the VeChain community after Know Your Customer (KYC) processes.\n\nVeChain\u2019s blockchain circulates two tokens. The first, VET, is the network\u2019s primary medium of exchange for governance and payments. The second, VeThor (VTHO), is a token for a lower transaction fee model that is credited to VeChain users daily based on the amount of VET they hold. VeThor is used to executing smart contracts and transactions on the VeChain blockchain. \n\nVeChain blockchain users are categorized as users and service providers.

With the creation of the non-for profit <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/stellar-development-foundation\">Stellar Development Foundation</a> (SDF), the team aimed to \"promote global financial access, literacy, and inclusion...and create an open and affordable financial system where people of all income levels can access simple-to-use, secure, and low cost financial services.\" The Stellar Development Foundation was created in collaboration with Stripe CEO Patrick Collison. Stripe invested $3 million in seed funding and received 2 billion Stellar Lumens (XLM) in exchange. At launch the network generated 100 billion XLM and featured a 1% annual issuance rate. \n\nIn 2015, Stellar redesigned its consensus protocol following a ledger fork in 2014 that rolled back hours of transactions. It's new and current consensus protocol called \"Stellar Consensus Protocol\" was developed by Stanford professor <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/david-mazi-res\">David Mazi\u00e8res</a>, chief scientist of the SDF. In 2017, Jed McCaleb and Brit Yonge launched <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/interstellar\">Lightyear</a> as a for-profit entity of Stellar, that would build a universal payment network on Stellar. In 2017, Stellar announced a grants program that would award partners up to $2 million worth of Lumens for project development.\n\nIn October 2019 Stellar removed the 1% annual issuance rate from the Stellar protocol stating that it was not benefiting the projects building on Stellar.\n\nIn November 2019, the Stellar Development Foundation <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/stellar-development-foundation-burns-more-than-half-of-lumen-supply-with-new-strategy-focus\">announced</a> it burned more than 55 billion XLM (~55%) tokens as it moves away from airdrop programs. Previously the foundation had retained 68 billion XLM earmarked for giveaways in order to grow the community. Citing a declining utility from airdrops, the SDF burned 50 billion of those tokens along with 5 billion of the 17 billion previously held in its operating fund. The burn reduced the total supply to 50 billion XLM of which SDF's ownership of the total dropped from XLM supply from 85% to 60%.\n", "issuing_organizations": [{"slug": "stellar-development-foundation", "name": "Stellar Development Foundation ", "logo": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/1%2A0ZyISskMlUEN8KyelN1-ZA.png", "description": "Stellar Development Foundation is a nonprofit organization taht designs and develops an online financial platform.

Nevertheless, those distribution mechanisms initially designed by the SDF proved hard to effectively execute:\nOut of the 20 billion XLM to be distributed to Bitcoin holders (19 billion) and XRP holders (1 billion), only 2.037 billion were distributed in two rounds, in\u00a0October 2016 and\u00a0August 2017. The rest (17.963 billion) was re-allocated to the SDF operational budget in 2017. As such, the SDF increased its operational budget, initially set at 3 billion XLM by 600% through this re-allocation. \nOut of the 50 billion XLM to be distributed through the Direct Sign-up program, the SDF only managed to effectively distribute 4.2 billion XLM, less than 10% of what was originally planned. \nOut of the 25 billion XLM to be distributed through the Partnership program, the SDF only managed to effectively distribute 1.138 billion XLM, less than 5% of what was originally planned. It's also interesting to note that the address that received this 1.138 billion XLM sent then back to the SDF-managed address in November 2019, right before the SDF burnt 55 billion XLM, as detailed below. \n\nGlobally, the SDF only managed to distribute 7.375 billion XLM through these three programs, instead of the 95 billion initially scheduled. \n\nBuilt-in Inflation Mechanism\n\nUntil October 2019, the Stellar ledger also featured a built-in, fixed, nominal inflation mechanism. New Lumens were added to the network at a rate of 1% each year. Each week, the protocol would distribute these Lumens to any account that receives over 0.05% of the \u201cvotes\u201d from other accounts in the network.  Given the very high supply concentration within the SDF treasury addresses due to the inefficiency of the distribution mechanisms, the SDF would receive over 95% of the votes, and thus 95% of the built-in inflation, increasing its operational budget by more than 4 billion XLM thanks to this built-in inflation mechanism. In October 2019 Stellar removed the 1% annual issuance rate from the Stellar protocol stating that it was not benefiting the projects building on Stellar.\n\n2017 Inflation Exploit\n\nFrom January to April 2017, Stellar suffered a serious inflation bug, <a href=\"https://messari.io/c/research/stellar-s-2017-inflation-exploit\">discovered in 2019 by Messari</a>. The bug was exploited, significantly inflationary, and patched with little publicity in April 2017. The attacker was able to create over 2.2 billion Lumens worth nearly $10 million at the time. Once it discovered and patched the bug, the SDF destroyed the equivalent number of coins that were created through the bug. Nevertheless, the XLM burned to offset the inflation bug came from the Direct Sing-up program allocation. As such, the SDF burnt supply that was meant to be distributed to the crowd to offset an inflation bug that was exploited by an attacker.\n\nOverhang burning\n\nConscious of the difficulty the distribute this important supply overhang, the SDF decided to burn more than 55 billion XLM in November 2019.\n37.6 billion XLM were burned from the Direct Sign-up Program allocation, reducing the supply left to be distributed to 4 billion XLM. As a result, instead of distributing 50 billion XLM through the Direct Sign-up program, the SDF will only distribute a maximum of 8.2 billion XLM (4.2 billion distributed from 2015 to 2019 and 4 billion left to be distributed). \n12.988 billion XLM were burned from the Partnership program, reducing the supply left to be distributed to 8 billion XLM. As a result, instead of distribution 25 billion XLM through the Partnership program, the SDF will only distribute a maximum of 8 billion XLM. \n4.88 billion XLM were burned from the SDF operational budget. Nevertheless, this burn only offset the newly issued XLM received through the built-in inflation during the first 5 years of the protocol. \n\nThrough this burn, the SDF reduced the maximum supply from 105 billion XLM to 50 billion XLM.

In an FBA system, there are quorums and quorum slices. Quorum is a set of nodes sufficient to reach agreement. Given that an FBA system is open participation, meaning that participants can join and leave as they please, it is impossible for the system to know how many nodes are sufficient for quorum without knowing the identities and amounts of nodes in the system. Thus, FBA introduces a concept of quorum slices nodes. A quorum slice is a subset of a quorum that can convince one particular node about agreement. In an FBA system nodes broadcast and individually determine which quorums slices to trust, and build their own quorum based on the information they have at hand. In FBA systems it is crucial that these quoroms overlap to ensure the network reaches consensus. Ripple for example, provides a list of trusted validators to use in order ensure there is overlap when participating in the Ripple Consensus Protocol (RCP). \n\nConsensus in FBA systems is reached through a multi round process where validators share ledger candidates between each other, adding and subtracting transactions until their candidate proposals match what their validators in their quorom slice proposed. Once a supermajority is reached, each server independently computes a new ledger hash from the agreed-upon set of transactions and compares results. Once a super majority of validators agree upon the hash of the new ledger candidate, the ledger candidate is considered final.\n\nSCP differentiates itself from RCP in that validators can choose their own quorom slices rather than using a pre-defined one (from Ripple). Furthermore, rather than relying on a super majority of nodes for consensus SCP introduces notions of validator quality, where validators are weighted based on trustworthiness and reliability, and validator grouping, where validators are grouped by organization. SCP posit these additions allow for stronger quorums.\n", "general_consensus_mechanism": "Other", "precise_consensus_mechanism": "Stellar Consensus Protocol", "targeted_block_time": 4, "block_reward": null, "mining_algorithm": null, "next_halving_date": null, "is_victim_of_51_percent_attack": false}}, "native_treasury": {"accounts": [], "treasury_usage_details": null}}, "technology": {"overview": {"technology_details": "The Stellar blockchain consensus mechanism is called Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), an implementation of the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA). The FBA is a fairly new consensus mechanism pioneered by Ripple. The SCP is the first provable safe FBA blockchain protocol.\n\nAn FBA allows nodes to choose which peers the trust based on intrinsic or extrinsic factors set by the nodes. This dynamic creates network-wide quorums as individual nodes relay and verify network activity information. FBAs rely on \u201cquorum slices\u201d to reach consensus\u2014subsets of a quorum that can convince an individual node to agree with the \u201cslice.\u201d Stellar nodes can choose their own quorum slices.\n\nTo attack the Stellar network, a reputable institution would need to control 51% or more of the network\u2019s trusted nodes. Stellar disinventivizes this by financial rewarding honest actors in the network via fees and other rewards. Stellar also adds an element of reputation and social identity by keeping network actors as known entities, which incentivizes financial institutions to maintain the trust of their peers.\n\nSome of these trusted financial institutions are called Anchors, a crucial part of the Stellar blockchain network. Anchors maintain wallets with fiat and XLM balances to allow currency exchange. Anchors control the fees they charge for network peers to use their services, and users can pick which anchor manages their exchanges.\n\nThe Stellar blockchain also supports launching native assets similar to issuing tokens on Ethereum. Compared to Ethereum, Stellar aims to offer faster transactions and lower network fees. All assets on the Stellar blockchain are not traded only by exchanging credits across between accounts in the network that are managed by anchors.

Many of the original team members met playing Cryptokitties, and it was their first time ever using blockchain for non-trading activities. Axie Infinity differs from a typical game because it leverages blockchain incentives to reward players economically for their contributions to the ecosystem. This mechanism, dubbed \"Play-to-Earn\", has grown increasingly popular in developing nations like the Philippines, Argentina, and Venezuela. In some of these places, the economic opportunities present in-game exceed those available in the real world. \n\nAxie has served as the on-ramp into crypto for many thousands of users. As of July 2021, the Axie counts 568K Discord Users and 450K Daily Average Users (DAUs) of the game itself. Axie Infinity collects revenues comparable to those of other DeFi Protocols. Axie has generated a venerable internal economy, especially relative to other blockchain virtual worlds like Decentraland, SomniumSpace, Cryptovoxels, and Sandbox. In fact, because the barrier to entry is high for players to begin earning, a banking layer has taken form in Yield Guild. This \"NFT bank\" rents Axies to scholars who don't have sufficient capital to kick off their Axie journey. \n\nAxie's creators identified and set out to remedy a fundamental flaw in the Web2 gaming model: the value generated in games like Fortnite accrued solely to the platform owners. Web2 in-game assets were merely rented from the platform, not owned by users or freely tradeable. These assets could be easily be wiped if an account were banned. This hamstrung the potential value embedded in virtual worlds and disempowered users. Axie hands the keys of the virtual world to the users, allowing them to modify the digital topography and maintain full sovereignty over their arithmetically scarce assets.", "issuing_organizations": []}, "roadmap": [{"title": "Sky Mavis starts development of Axie Infinity", "date": "2017-12-01T00:00:00Z", "type": "Development", "details": "Axie team kicks off building"}, {"title": "Origin Axie Presale", "date": "2018-02-01T00:00:00Z", "type": "NFT Auction", "details": "Raised 900 ETH via sale of the first round of Axies, the core assets and ERC-721 NFTS within the Axie Infinity world.

Finally, $AXS acts as work token in that it is spent, along with $SLP (discussed below) in order to breed new Axies. Breeding fees are currently 4 $AXS and are directed to the treasury. The treasury will at some point be governed by the community of $AXS holders.\n\n$AXS is an ERC-20 token, meaning that users with Ethereum wallets can freely buy and sell it. It can be acquired or sold on a variety of marketplaces, including Binance and Uniswap. \n\nAxie Infinity actually uses a dual-token structure. Smooth Love Potion ($SLP) is the other in-game fungible ERC-20 token. SLP is burned to enable Axies to breed and create new Axies. Axie Infinity utilizes a burn algorithm that adjusts the Axie breeding costs, denominated in $SLP, upwards overtime, introducing scarcity. $SLP is rewarded to players who've won battles or participated in adventure mode, hence the \"play-to-earn\" descriptor.

All unique in-game assets are represented by ERC-721 NFTs that live in users' wallets. In-game currencies SLP and AXS are fungible ERC-20 tokens. Axie combines the \"digital property rights\" that NFTs enable with algorithmic scarcity. Axies have finite breeding caps and the algorithm will adjust upwards the cost of breeding, denominated in SLP, as the user base grows. \n\nTo account for scale in adoption and transactions, Sky Mavis created a purpose-built side chain called Ronin. The full Ronin migration was executed by mid-2021. Ronin permits for higher transaction throughput and lower gas fees for users. The Sky Mavis team also built out a simplified Ronin Wallet for smoother onboarding. Despite building out Ronin for transaction scaling, the explosion in Daily Average Users (450K during July 2021) overwhelmed servers, disrupting gameplay. As of July 2021, consensus on Ronin is reached via Proof of Authority. The Sky Mavis team plans to decentralize consensus via permitting community involvement. In an AMA on June 30, 2020 the Sky Mavis CEO Trung Ngyugen explained that the team may consider Delegated Proof of Stake (dPos). \n\nSimilar to Roblux or Minecraft, Axie Infinity sacrifices a high-fidelity, realistic gaming experience for a smooth, unsharded user experience.

It enables the IC to have a single public key, which is small enough (in size) to allow any device, like smartwatches and mobile phones, to verify the authenticity of artifacts from the Internet Computer.\n\nChain Key Technology is the engine that drives the Internet Computer and makes its operation possible. It allows for:\nAdding new nodes to form new subnets to help scale the network\nReplacing faulty or crashed nodes with new ones without stopping\nReviving subnets even if too many nodes within have failed\nUpgrading the Internet Computer Protocol, allowing the network to fix bugs and add new features\n\nThe DFINITY R&D team has also invented a new noninteractive key resharing protocol. Each of the old signers only needs to broadcast a single message to the new signers. To ensure that this is done securely, many concepts from advanced cryptography are utilized, including encryption with forward secrecy and noninteractive zero-knowledge proofs. Because it is noninteractive, the way the key resharing protocol operates is ideal for an asynchronous environment, and the benefits include key preservation.

It uses a <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/directed-acyclic-graph-dag\">Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</a> based algorithm to achieve asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerance (aBFT). Lachesis has four key qualities:\nAsynchronous: Participants have the freedom to process commands at different times\nLeaderless: No participant plays a \u201cspecial\u201d role in block production\nByzantine Fault-Tolerant: Supports one-third of faulty nodes\nNear-Instant Finality: Transactions are confirmed in 1-2 seconds.\n\nFantom has implemented Lachesis as a consensus layer that can extend to additional layers within the system. The Fantom ecosystem may eventually consist of multiple blockchain layers with Lachesis at the core. The first additional layer within Fantom was Opera, an EVM-compatible smart contract platform that launched in December 2019. Opera is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) layer whose validator set uses Lachesis to validate transactions and produce new blocks. It now features several decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, including SushiSwap and Curve.\n\nIn May 2019, Fantom announced that it would with Binance Chain to improve interoperability through the creation of a multi-asset and cross-chain ecosystem. This multi-asset initiative would introduce various new token standards to Fantom, including Fantom versions of Ethereum's ERC-20 and Binance Chain's BEP-2. These standards set the stage for integrating popular Ethereum applications on Opera in early 2021.\n\nThe Fantom Foundation has turned its focus towards DeFi use cases with the help of Yearn Finance founder Andre Cronje, who serves as a technical advisor to Fantom.

Its technology acts as an incentive layer for the peer-to-peer file transfer system IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), which uses hash-addressed content structures to store data instead of centralized servers and IP addresses. This is intended to reduce redundancy, increase permanence, and improve efficiency. \n\nFilecoin incentivizes IPFS by rewarding storage providers and retrievers for contributing resources to the system. The network also comes with built-in Ethereum integration allowing developers to access data on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain and interact with its smart contracts.\n\nFilecoin is being developed by Protocol Labs, a development firm founded in 2014 by Juan Benet. Benet and crew constructed Filecoin and IPFS in tandem, raising a few Seed equity rounds to fund the process. In 2017, the team hosted a token sale to secure funds for Filecoin's development, which raised around $205 million in one of the largest token offerings at the time.\n\nProtocol Labs seeks to build a fundamental layer for data infrastructure that can be used by both blockchain and traditional providers, like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. The project plans to achieve this goal by creating a marketplace in which any user who has storage capacity can connect to the network, creating a supply of unused storage both in consumer hardware as well as data centers of existing businesses. The Filecoin team believes this will reduce the price of storage in a way similar to how sharing economy companies like Airbnb reduced the price of short-term rentals in marketplaces traditionally dominated by large players with large capital requirements.", "issuing_organizations": [{"slug": "protocol-labs", "name": "Protocol Labs", "logo": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/xwRfPxqt_400x400.jpg", "description": "Protocol Labs is a research, development, and deployment institution for improving Internet technology with great user experience design and an open-source approach to creation."}]}, "roadmap": [{"title": "Devnets", "date": "2019-03-31T04:00:00Z", "type": "Testnet Launch", "details": "Use-case specific devnets opened to protocol developers, miners, and other users to work with"}, {"title": "Internal Testnet", "date": "2019-06-30T04:00:00Z", "type": "Testnet Launch", "details": "Testnet of go-filecoin nodes starting in 100s, gradually ramping up orders of magnitude"}, {"title": "Alphanet Launch", "date": "2019-09-25T04:00:00Z", "type": "Testnet Launch", "details": "The alphanet is a long-running Filecoin network"}, {"title": "Public Testnet: Phase 1", "date": "2019-12-11T05:00:00Z", "type": "Testnet Launch", "details": "Filecoin's first public testnet will allow prospective storage miners and clients to start experimenting with the mining hardware requirements and the data storage/retrieval capabilities of the network.

The market value of the file in question determines the miner's payout. Available bandwidth and initial response time for details (which could be influenced by network latency or proximity to a client) impact a miner's ability to close deals and retrieve data on the network. Therefore, the \"maximum bandwidth of a retrieval miner will set the total quantity of deals\" they can win.\n\nWith the network still in development, the mining equipment specifications (specifically for CPU and RAM) remain unknown.

Filecoin is secured by proof-of-work in the same way that bitcoin is, but this work is specifically related to storage of data Instead of finding a random nonce to make the block hash fit in a target range, the networks proof-of-work is restricted to proving that a miner has stored data for a specific duration and replication. This is achieved with two new types of proof-of-work: proof-of-replication (PoRep) and proof-of-spacetime (PoSt). \n\nProof-of-replication allows a server to convince a user that some data has been replicated to its own uniquely dedicated physical storage while proof-of-spacetime allows an efficient prover to convince a verifier that they are storing some data for a specified duration of time. \n\nThese proofs allow Filecoin to solve issues with large-scale storage networks made of independent parties, by making it theoretically impossible to falsify data storage records to increase miner rewards. Competitors like Siacoin ($SC) and Storj ($STORJ) lack this functionality, though they have not yet created enough storage demand for this to be a significant issue. \n\nMiner proofs are used to create a network based on three primary methods, put, get, and manage. The put and get methods are responsible for putting data in storage and accessing it on client request respectively. The manage method is responsible for managing the marketplace by matching buy and sell orders as well as managing buyer and seller reputation on the platform. \n\nThese methods are executed across two marketplaces, storage and retrieval, which are managed by the different miners. Protocol Labs believes that miners will often participate in both markets. Storage miners are responsible for receiving put requests and storing client data while also pledging collateral proportional to the data. They will be penalized by losing this collateral in the event of invalid or missing proofs. Storage providers run the manage method in conjunction with clients and auditors. Retrieval miners are responsible for managing get requests and giving clients their data. While retrieval miners do not need to pledge collateral, they are still compensated in the native Filecoin for performing work for the network.

Exodus\u2019 goal is to provide a simple distributed file sharing built on something similar to IPFS. \nOdyssey: introducing financial incentives to encourage content creation. Odyssey is supposed to incentivize early adopters and foster the growth of a community consisting of content creators and consumers. Reimbursement for creation will be through a tipping scheme, instead of views and clicks - as those methods can be easily exploited through bots.\nGreat Voyage: launching TRON-native ICO capability. Tron looks to allow content creators to offer a stake in a potential personal brand through individual ICOs or branded tokens. \nApollo: enable content producers to issue personal tokens\nStar Trek: brings a decentralized gaming and forecasting platform.\nEternity: aim for further decentralization of the gaming industry. This phase aims to bring the ability to fund-raise and monetize based on community growth. \n\nEventually, Tron\u2019s core technology will be based on the adaptation of IPFS and Ethereum\u2019s platform. In short, what Tron is trying to create is a huge mixture of what is already being done by other projects. Relatedly, Tron is criticized for plagiarism regarding its white paper.

Super representatives are chosen through a voting system that allows users to vote based on the tokens that they hold.\n\nTron\u2019s chain has a 3-tiered architecture: the storage layer, core layer, and application layer. The storage layer adopts a distributed protocol branched into block storage and state storage. Its underlying storage layer uses the graph database to manage data storage, which aims to manage data storage as Tron not only stores the node data but also inter-node connections. Its middle layer is composed of modules of smart contracts, account management, consensus and more. \n\nTronix (TRX) is the official name for the native Tron token. Miners earn TRX by providing data storage space to network users. Tron intends to be used as market model rather than a cloud model. Tron expects TRX tokens to act as a mediator between consumers and content creators without the need for token exchanges. It was initially an ERC20 token.

Ethereum Classic is the legacy chain that split from <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> following a contentious hard fork, known as The DAO fork, in Jul. 2017. Like its sister chain, Ethereum Classic features an execution engine optimized for smart contract processing (known as the Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM) and a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus system. While it shares some aspects with Ethereum, Ethereum Classic offers a more defined monetary policy and inflation schedule.", "official_links": [{"name": "Ethereum Whitepaper", "link": "https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/"}, {"name": "Ethereum Classic Independence", "link": "https://ethereumclassic.org/blog/2016-08-13-declaration-of-independence"}, {"name": "Github", "link": "http://github.com/ethereumclassic"}, {"name": "Website", "link": "https://ethereumclassic.org/"}, {"name": "Twitter", "link": "https://twitter.com/eth_classic"}, {"name": "Telegram", "link": "https://telegram.me/ethclassic"}, {"name": "Reddit", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/"}, {"name": "Blog", "link": "https://ethereumclassic.org/blog/"}]}, "background": {"background_details": "The DAO hack gives rise to Ethereum Classic\nThe DAO hack and resulting <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/hard-fork\">hard fork</a> split the Ethereum network into two separate chains: <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> and Ethereum Classic (ETC). The DAO was an Ethereum-based venture fund that managed to raise ~$150 million in Ether in an April 2016 <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/initial-coin-offering-ico\">initial coin offering (ICO)</a>.  A few months later (July 2016), an attacker exploited a bug in one of The DAO's smart contracts, enabling the hacker to steal 3.6 million ETH of the funds collected in its ICO.\n\nA divide in the community formed around how to resolve the issue. One camp believed reverting the chain, thus erasing the hack from the network's history, was necessary to preserve the longevity of Ethereum. The other side reasoned mutability was antithetical to the ethos of crypto networks and refused to accept a ledger rewrite. The divide led to a contentious hard fork at block 1,920,001, and the legacy chain that did not reverse its transaction history rebranded to Ethereum Classic.\n\nBefore the DAO fork split the original Ethereum chain, there was just one group of users, service providers, developers, investors, and other network participants. The hard fork or \"irregular state change\" split not only the protocol layer but also the social and application layers. As the legacy chain, Ethereum Classic inherited the components outlined within the Ethereum whitepaper. At the time of the fork, Ethereum Classic was still identical to Ethereum regarding these original components. However, it soon began to diverge away from Ethereum by announcing its own roadmap and vision.\n\nPhilosophy and monetary policy change\nThe Ethereum Classic (ETC) community stresses the core principals of censorship resistance and (most prominently) immutability. And as a continuation of the Ethereum blockchain, it features a Turing-complete <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/smart-contracts\">smart contract</a> language to support the development of more complex <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-applications-dapps\">decentralized applications (dApps)</a>. The Ethereum Classic community governs the network by the motto \"Code is Law,\" which instills the belief that ETC transactions and dApps are truly censorship-resistant and immune to any third party interference.\n\nETC later (March 2017) adopted a new, Bitcoin-like monetary policy fit with a fixed supply cap and disinflationary emission schedule. The proposal drastically deviated from the original Ethereum monetary policy, which remains in flux as Ethereum core devs look to establish a more concrete economic model for its future <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-stake\">Proof of Stake (PoS)</a> network. Instead of monetary flexibility (and some uncertainty), Ethereum Classic now features a max supply of 210,700,000 tokens and miner reward reductions every five million blocks. And unlike Ethereum, the community intends to stick with <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\">Proof of Work (PoW)</a> as its consensus and token issuance mechanism.  \n\nDevelopment teams and future developments\nETC's structure varies from most blockchain projects, incorporating multiple development teams (IOHK, ETC Labs, and ETC Cooperative), each with their own goals. In general, most of these teams have focused on providing sidechain <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/scaling\">scaling</a> solutions, improving development tools (SDKs), and promoting cross-chain transactions so others can build on Ethereum Classic. Some of these efforts, including Connext's state channels and ChainSafe's bridge to Ethereum and Cosmos SDK-based chains, have already launched.\n\nETC is one of the few cryptocurrencies where investors can gain exposure to it through a traditional brokerage and or retirement account. Grayscale Investments created an Ethereum Classic Investment Trust (ticker ETCG) that allows investors to gain exposure to ETC without having to store or secure it directly.\n\n51% attacks\nAs a minority chain using the Ethash mining algorithm, Ethereum Classic has been the target of multiple 51% attacks. The first attack occurred in Jan. 2019, when crypto exchange Coinbase <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/updated-ethereum-classic-has-experienced-multiple-100-reorg-attack-ethereum-classic-claims-not-an-attack-new-miners-being-tested-coinbase-rebuts\">detected</a> a deep chain reorganization of the Ethereum Classic blockchain. The number of identified reorganizations eventually increased to a total of fifteen, twelve of which contained double spends, totaling 219,500 ETC (~$1.1 million).\n\nIn Aug. 2020, Ethereum Classic suffered three more 51% attacks. The first one resulted in a successful double-spend of 807,260 ETC (~$5.6 million at the time). The second attack occurred less than a week later and exhibited a similar reorg depth (about 4,000 blocks). The final Aug. 2020 attack resulted in a large reorg of 7,000 blocks, but there is no sign of a double-spend attempt as of yet. As for a possible solution, the ETC Cooperative would like to switch Ethereum Classic's hashing algorithm from Ethash to either Keccak-256 or SHA-3, which would mean Ethereum Classic would no longer be a minority chain and would potentially be less susceptible to similar attacks.", "issuing_organizations": []}, "roadmap": [{"title": "Ethereum Launches", "date": "2015-07-30T04:00:00Z", "type": "Network Launch", "details": "Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation create the first blockchain-based, Turing-complete smart contract platform"}, {"title": "The DAO Hard Fork", "date": "2016-07-20T04:00:00Z", "type": "Hard Fork", "details": "The DAO hard fork activates at block 1,920,000, with around 80% of network nodes updating to the new client."}, {"title": "Ethereum Classic Split and Rebrand", "date": "2016-07-20T04:00:00Z", "type": "Network Launch", "details": "The hard fork split the original Ethereum chain into two separate networks.

It is a Turing-complete virtual machine featuring a specific language \u201cEVM bytecode,\u201d typically written in a higher-level language called Solidity or others such as the Python-based Vyper. Every operation on the EVM requires computational effort and memory. Ethereum Classic node operators and miners provide these resources to application developers and network users in exchange for gas.\n\nThe fee to make transactions or execute smart contract operations on ETC is (gas price) * (gas limit), and fees are paid to miners for including your transactions in a block. The gas limit is the maximum amount of gas users are willing to spend on a transaction, whereas the gas price is the cost users are willing to pay for each gas unit. A normal transaction on the network costs 21,000 gas but costs more if you are trying to execute something more complex as that requires more computational power. Users can also speed up their transactions by raising the gas price since that will incentivize miners to include the transaction(s) in the next block to receive those fees.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) uses Ethash as its <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\">Proof-of-Work (PoW)</a> algorithm. New blocks are generated every 15 seconds, on average, and the current miner reward for each new block found is 3.2 ETC which is reduced by 20% every 5 million blocks (about 2.4 years). ETC will be mineable until around 2070 when miners will reach the soft supply cap of between 210 million and 230 million. In addition to miner rewards, ETC rewards miners for discovering \u201cuncle blocks\u201d. Uncle blocks are valid blocks that arrived too late, meaning another miner already solved the PoW and claimed that block height's reward. This practice aims to decrease mining centralization, reduce the chance of unintentional forks, and boost network security. Every new block can contain at most two uncle blocks. Uncle block rewards are 3.125% of the miners' reward or 0.125 ETC.", "client_repositories": [{"name": "Core-Geth", "link": "https://github.com/etclabscore/core-geth", "license_type": "LGPL 3.0"}, {"name": "Hyperledger Besu", "link": "https://github.com/hyperledger/besu", "license_type": "Apache 2.0"}, {"name": "Mantis", "link": "https://github.com/input-output-hk/mantis", "license_type": "Apache 2.0"}]}, "security": {"audits": [{"title": "IOHK Mantis Security Audit", "date": "2018-01-26T00:00:00Z", "type": "Client Security", "details": "Kudelski Security Research ran a security audit of the Mantis client implementation codebase.\n\n[Full Audit Report](https://research.kudelskisecurity.com/2018/01/26/audit-report-of-iohks-etc-wallet/)"}, {"title": "ETC Multi-Sig Bug Audit", "date": "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z", "type": "Contract Security", "details": "Dexaran of Ethereum Commonwealth completed an audit of the Ethereum Classic multi-sig wallet, which is an implementation of Open Zeppelin's [multi-sig contract code](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/v1.2.0/contracts/MultisigWallet.sol).\n\n[Full Audit Report](https://gist.github.com/Dexaran/2389d5e7290ab69709d33abfe0485bec)"}], "known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities": [{"title": "Classic Ether Wallet hack", "date": "2017-06-29T04:00:00Z", "type": "Hack", "details": "On 29 June 2017, the Ethereum Classic Twitter account made a public statement indicating a reason to believe that the website for Classic Ether Wallet had been compromised.

In this model, anyone can submit code changes, dubbed Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals (ECIP), that aim to either modify the core protocol or even the ECIP process itself. The ECIP process takes after the EIP and BIP systems used in Ethereum and Bitcoin, respectively.\n\nOnce the author submits a proposal, they must champion it to be successful, which consists of the author making themselves available to answer any questions from network stakeholders. Proposals must also pass through several stages before being implemented into node client software.\n\nProposals begin in the \u201cDraft Stage,\u201d and if successful, make their way to the \u201cAccepted Stage.\u201d Submissions must pass each stage by a rough consensus. Client developers may add the submitted changes to their clients at their discretion.

As they explored the solution space and tried out a variety of blockchain protocols, they realized the current state of the tech didn\u2019t meet their needs and began to design a blockchain that could. Illia and Alex gathered a team of engineers and formally started building NEAR Protocol in August 2018.  The founding vision for the NEAR platform was to offer developers an easy path to building decentralized applications that can scale to mass usage. To achieve these goals, NEAR adopted a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism to support transaction verification and block production. \n\nNEAR combines a horizontal scaling approach with a new consensus mechanism that splits the network into parallel shards and dynamically distributes the computation to increase the network's processing capacity.

Nightshade models the system as a single blockchain. The list of all the transactions in each block is split into physical chunks, one chunk per shard. All chunks accumulate to one block. Note that chunks can only be validated by nodes that maintain the state of that shard. \n\nTheoretically, each logical block contains all the transactions for all the shards. However, since transmitting a logical block across the network would be prohibitively expensive, it is never initiated. Instead, each network participant maintains the state that corresponds to the shards that they validate transactions for and any additional shard that they want to track. \n\nThe consensus is based on the heaviest chain consensus. Meaning, once a block producer publishes a block, they collect the signatures of validator nodes. The weight of a block is then the cumulative stake of all the signers whose signatures are included in the block. The weight of a chain is the sum of the block weights. Additionally, the consensus utilises a finality gadget that introduces additional slashing conditions for higher chain security. \n\nResources:\nNightshade Whitepaper\nHow to run a node", "general_consensus_mechanism": "Proof-of-Stake", "precise_consensus_mechanism": "Nightshade", "targeted_block_time": null, "block_reward": null, "mining_algorithm": null, "next_halving_date": null, "is_victim_of_51_percent_attack": null}}, "native_treasury": {"accounts": [], "treasury_usage_details": null}}, "technology": {"overview": {"technology_details": "  NEAR\u2019s blockchain uses a new consensus algorithm and a sharding architecture to achieve a relatively high level of performance. The key elements of NEAR\u2019s technology are:\nDynamic Re-Sharding\nNightshade\nDoomslug\nFees as Developer Rewards\nToken Balance-Based Storage\n\nDynamic Re-Sharding\nThere are two ways to approach scalability - Horizontal and Vertical. NEAR has chosen to use sharding, which is a type of horizontal scaling technique. Sharding is an approach to scaling databases, and it involves spreading computing and storage capacity across multiple servers. In the world of blockchains, sharding involves partitioning a blockchain across subgroups of nodes and distributes computation across multiple parallelized sub-chains (\"shards\"). Sharding is not live on NEAR at the moment.\n\nOnce sharding goes live on NEAR, the network intends to regularly adjust the number of shards supported by the network based on user demand. The project calls this demand-based approach to scaling \"Dynamic re-sharding.\" This scheme allows the network to only pay for the infrastructure and scale it needs at any given time. Dynamic re-sharding might be a more cost-efficient approach to scaling and securing a sharded network since node storage requirements can adjust with demand.\n\nNightshade\nNEAR uses a new sharding approach called Nightshade to reach consensus and settle cross-shard transactions. Most sharded networks use a smaller validator committee that rotates its lead block proposer when validating transactions across shards. This approach introduces some difficulties to the validation process. For instance, these validator groups must either download the entire state of each shard or receive only the portion that changed. The validation process for either technique can be inefficient as the first one requires a bigger time frame and the second one requires a larger state size.\n\nNightshade offers a different model by modifying the typical sharding abstraction. It assumes that each shard works together to produce \"chunks\" of data that collectively create a single block.\u00a0Blocks are produced with a regular cadence regardless of whether each individual shard has produced its \u201cchunk\u201d for that specific block height. Nightshade is a leader-based system, meaning it assigns a single validator to produce each block.\u00a0This validator must assemble the data chunks generated by each shard during their leadership period into a block.\u00a0Leadership assignments will rotate through the existing validator set. Validators don't accept transactions, only chunks.\n\nDoomslug\nDoomslug is NEAR Protocol's new block production technique. According to the team, it enables the network to achieve some sense of practical finality after one round of communication, with a finality gadget providing BFT finality after a secondround.  Practical finality in Doomslug (or Doomslug finality) is when a block is irreversible unless at least one participant is slashed. Doomslug also allows the network to continue producing and finalizing blocks as long as over half of the validator set are online and honest, although the finality gadget will stall if less than two-thirds of participants are online.\n\nFees as Developer Rewards\nNEAR distributes 30% of any transaction fee to the contract (or contracts) that transaction calls. The contract\u2019s owner (often a developer group or a DAO) can decide how to allocate these funds. These fee \u201crewards'' effectively incentivize early application development on NEAR. The percentage of fees allocated to this reward is a system-level parameter (can be adjusted by governance), but developers may choose to receive any amount equal to or above this minimum value.\n\nToken-Based Storage\nNEAR token holders have the right to store data on the chain. For example, if someone holds a balance of 1 NEAR, it means that the person can store nearly 10 KB of data on the account. This model is similar to how checking accounts in banks require a minimum balance to have an account. It allows contracts that are maintaining important state to pay validators proportionally to the amount of data they are securing.\n", "client_repositories": [{"name": "NearCore", "link": "https://github.com/near/nearcore", "license_type": " GPL-3.0"}]}, "security": {"audits": [{"title": "Nearcore", "date": "2019-10-11T00:00:00Z", "type": "Security", "details": "Sigma Prime conducted an audit of Near Protocol's nearcore, specifically:\n- chain (p2p stack, serialization, JSON RPC, syncing mechanism, etc); ** \n- *near (entry point for running the node);*  \n- core (cryptographic primitives, storage, merkelization helper functions)"}, {"title": "Nearcore Runtime", "date": "2019-11-15T00:00:00Z", "type": "Security", "details": "Trail of Bits conducted an audit of nearcore runtime, specifically: \n- *near-runtime-fees* \n- near-vm-errors  \n- *near-vm-logic*\n- near-vm-runner  \n- *near-vm-runner-standalone*  \n- runtime  \n- runtime-params-estimator"}, {"title": "Near-Core", "date": "2020-01-12T00:00:00Z", "type": "Security", "details": "Sigma Prime conducted an audit on the NEAR protocol's near-core chain and near-bindgen on Jan. 21, 2020."}, {"title": "Initial Smart Contracts", "date": "2020-06-14T00:00:00Z", "type": "Security", "details": "Sigma Prime conducted the audit of Near Protocol's initial smart contract on Jun. 14, 2020.\n\nThe audit included review of Initial Smart Contracts, specifically:\n- [Fungible Token ](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/commit/add801738404a74813e74ed3e0447e9e64805c3a)\n- [Stack Pool](https://github.com/near/core-contracts/commit/56e9a9ce1b6c375fc9fbdc1b18048c7074fb1ee9)\n- [Lockup](https://github.com/near/core-contracts/commit/a9a15adc0ad6e52e414930a1485c996d1804783d)\n- [Whitelist](https://github.com/near/core-contracts/commit/4db54f32bceec45a470fe0acc21a3de270ffa686)\n- [Staking Pool Factory](https://github.com/near/core-contracts/commit/4db54f32bceec45a470fe0acc21a3de270ffa686)"}, {"title": "Rainbow Bridge", "date": "2020-08-14T00:00:00Z", "type": "Security", "details": "Consensys Dilligence & ABDK Consulting audited the Near Protocol's Rainbow bridge. \n\nThe audit included review of the Rainbow Bridge, specifically: \n- *All bridge smart contracts in Solidity and Rust;*\n- ED25519 implementation in Solidity;\n- Game theoretical components"}], "known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities": []}}, "governance": {"governance_details": "Network governance is open to contributions from the community.

"project_details": "Hedera Hashgraph is a distributed ledger of transactions, otherwise known as a <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/distributed-ledger-technology-dlt\">DLT</a> (distributed ledger technology). While blockchains are the most commonly used DLTs, Hedera is slightly different since it uses a new consensus algorithm known as hashgraph. The hashgraph consensus algorithm aims to process and finalize more transactions at scale than traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) networks, as they are often characterized by high latency and low transactions per second (tps). Hedera's state is stored on mainnet nodes, which are all currently run by members of the Hedera Governing Council. But in the future, mainnet nodes will be permissionless. These nodes secure the Hedera ledger by reaching a consensus on the validity and order of transactions.\n\nHedera provides two core network services: the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) and the Hedera Token Service (HTS). HCS allows clients to submit messages to the Hedera network for consensus timestamping and ordering, but it doesn't require the consensus nodes to store state related to that message. Instead, application state or data is persisted off-chain, where HCS users can define confidentiality and access control that cater to their use-case. The HTS supports native tokenization, whereby clients can create and manage various token types. Token controls include managing supply and KYC compliance, along with native atomic swaps and multi-sig capabilities.", "official_links": [{"name": "Whitepaper", "link": "https://hedera.com/hh_whitepaper_v2.1-20200815.pdf"}, {"name": "Website", "link": "https://www.hedera.com/"}, {"name": "Twitter", "link": "https://twitter.com/hedera"}, {"name": "Github", "link": "https://github.com/hashgraph"}, {"name": "Medium", "link": "https://medium.com/hashgraph"}, {"name": "Telegram", "link": "https://help.hedera.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005232217-Where-can-I-join-a-Telegram-or-Discord-group-"}, {"name": "Discord", "link": "https://help.hedera.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005232217-Where-can-I-join-a-Telegram-or-Discord-group-"}, {"name": "YouTube", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIhE4NYpaX9E9SssFnwrjww"}]}, "background": {"background_details": "Hedera Hashgraph Vision\nHashgraph is a relatively new consensus protocol that aims to process transactions faster than existing networks. Hedera layers Proof-of-Stake for consensus weighting, a fee & rewards model, a cryptocurrency, and the two key HCS and HTS services on top of hashgraph, Hedera's consensus algorithm. Since hashgraph has the potential to process transactions at a comparatively efficient rate, Hedera intends to be a platform that can support high-volume use cases, such as micropayments, data integrity, and tokenization. The network also supports a virtual machine that can compile smart contracts written in Solidity, similar to the EVM. Hedera intends to be compliant across jurisdictions by offering native support for optional KYC and AML checks via its \"Verified Identity\" mechanism.\n\nHedera will launch in a permissioned model with only the governing members running nodes. Over time, as the distribution of the network's native token, HBAR, improves, the node membership will transition from permissioned to fully permissionless, where any network participant can operator a Hedera consensus node.\n\nEntities Behind the Network\nHedera Hashgraph LLC is a US-based entity that is governed by 39 term-limited global enterprises across multiple industries. These entities manage Hedera's consensus nodes while collaborating to determine the protocol's future direction (i.e., Hedera's near-term governance model). Governing members are responsible for council membership, regulating network rules and tokens, and approving changes to the protocol. They also elect subcommittees that will operate traditional corporate functions such as Legal, Finance, and Marketing departments. Governing members receive fees from operating nodes to compensate for their security and governance contributions, but they do not take profits from the entity in their role as members.\n\nSwirlds is a separate company that owns the intellectual property of the hashgraph consensus algorithm and is an equal-weight governing member. Swirlds has licensed the technology to Hedera Hashgraph. The two entities will use the associated patent rights to legally prohibit anyone from forking the code and creating a competing platform and currency. While the consensus algorithm is not open source, it is \"open review,\" meaning anyone can verify there are no backdoors in the code. Additionally, Hedera's application development layer is open; no license is required to build Hedera applications.", "issuing_organizations": []}, "roadmap": [{"title": "Hashgraph Consortium Formed", "date": "2018-03-13T00:00:00Z", "type": "Project Operations", "details": "Hashgraph Consortium, LLC is created as a Delaware limited liability company.

The Hashgraph consensus algorithm is Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (ABFT). Every node participates in every round of consensus, meaning it doesn't rely on a single node or \"leader\" to order transactions each round. The consensus is ''fair in that it doesn\u2019t allow a leader to censor or unduly delay a given transaction.\n\nIn addition to ordering transactions, Hashgraph also issues a consensus timestamp for each transaction, calculated as the time at which the transaction reached a majority of the network. Once the consensus timestamp is determined then the transaction is final, which contrasts most Proof-of-Work (PoW) networks that rely on probabilistic finality. A formal proof of the consensus algorithm is available here. Hedera's fee model is not auction-based, a common model among most networks for submitting transactions. Without the concept of a fee auction, users can't pay more in fees to increase the likelihood of their transactions being ordered before transactions that may have been submitted earlier.\n\nHashgraph aims to process a high number of transactions per second (TPS) with low latency. The team has said Hedera's hashgraph consensus allows it to support over 10,000 transactions per second. The nature of these transactions has been disputed, as the 10,000 number may only represent cryptocurrency transactions and not any smart contract interactions. These disputes can be found here and here, while the Hedera team has issued a few rebuttals here and here.\n\nAs for how Hedera achieves this reportedly high TPS, it leverages two core components within Hashgraph: gossip about gossip and virtual voting. These components, along with weighting votes by stake, enable nodes to determine the consensus order of transactions. More information can be found here.", "general_consensus_mechanism": "Proof-of-Stake", "precise_consensus_mechanism": "Hashgraph", "targeted_block_time": null, "block_reward": null, "mining_algorithm": null, "next_halving_date": null, "is_victim_of_51_percent_attack": false}}, "native_treasury": {"accounts": [], "treasury_usage_details": null}}, "technology": {"overview": {"technology_details": "Hashgraph Consensus\nHedera uses hashgraph consensus, an alternative to blockchain consensus mechanisms. It achieves a lower latency on transaction finality because once consensus on the timestamp and order of transactions is reached, those transactions are applied to the state in that order. Hashgraphs attempts to remove the reliance on fee-based auctions for transaction inclusion, which can lead to greater fees when the native token fluctuates in price and the potential for higher levels of MEV (miner extractable value).\n\nConsensus Nodes\nHedera's public ledger being stored and run by the Hedera Governing Council. While running mainnet node is currently limited to Council members, Hedera eventually plans to make its network permissionless, allowing any participant to run a consensus node. Hedera nodes come to consensus on the validity and order of transactions. When the network transitions to a permissionless state, the influence of each node towards consensus will be weighted by the number of HBAR in their account. Hedera will run PoS (Proof-of-Stake) but without any stake bonding or slashing penalties. Hashgraph will function as the consensus and security layer, while the PoS layer will deter DoS (Denial of Service) attacks.\n\nConsensus nodes (currently run by Council members) will receive daily payments to compensate for their bandwidth, storage, and computing costs. These daily payments will be proportional to the stake the nodes have designated. Other accounts that proxy their stake to a node will receive smaller payments to incentivize them to select valid nodes.\n\nMirror nodes offer a cost-effective way to query historical data without trust loss. The key network services are cryptocurrency, consensus, and token services.\n\nNetwork Fees\nClients pay fees in HBARs for the network to process a transaction. The network attempts to keep fees low. For instance, transferring HBARs between accounts costs approximately $0.0001 USD according to the team. Fees are denominated in USD but charged in HBAR. Clients are given stability in fees since the network updates the exchange rate between HBAR and USD every hour to reflect the market price.", "client_repositories": [{"name": "Hedera Mirror Node", "link": "https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-mirror-node", "license_type": "Apache-2.0"}]}, "security": {"audits": [{"title": "Formal Verification of ABFT", "date": "2018-10-01T00:00:00Z", "type": "Security", "details": "COQ Proof conducted by Carnegie Mellon tested Hedera's hashgraph algorithm and its potential to be Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant.\n\n__Learn More:__\n[Coq Proof Audit](https://hedera.com/blog/coq-proof-completed-by-carnegie-mellon-professor-confirms-hashgraph-consensus-algorithm-is-asynchronous-byzantine-fault-tolerant)"}, {"title": "Formal Verification of Stablecoins on HCS", "date": "2020-10-28T00:00:00Z", "type": "Security", "details": "Quantstamp developed a formal specification for stablecoins built on Hedera Hashgraph and deployed using the Hedera Consensus Service to provide security guarantees for stablecoins on the platform.\n\n__Learn More:__\n[Formally Verifying Hedera Hashgraph's Stablecoin Framework](https://quantstamp.com/blog/quantstamp-stablecoin-case-study-formally-verifying-hedera-hashgraphs-stablecoin-framework)\n\n"}, {"title": "Hedera Technology Audit", "date": "2020-11-02T00:00:00Z", "type": "Security", "details": "Only minor issues identified.

He later released a white paper in Sept. 2014 that detailed more specifics about the project. Breitman published both articles under the pseudonym \"L. M Goodman\" akin to Bitcoin's anonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. In the documents, the author stressed Bitcoin's design failed to account for a more inclusive governance process and did not facilitate the creation of new tokens. Breitman and his wife <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/kathleen-breitman\">Kathleen</a>, therefore, designed Tezos as a token issuance and smart contract platform with an <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/on-chain-governance\">on-chain governance</a> model, which would allow XTZ holders to vote on proposed protocol upgrades to avoid forking the network.\n\nIn 2015, the Breitmans established a company called Dynamic Ledger Solutions (DLS), which was responsible for writing the initial code for Tezos. At its core, Tezos is a system designed to formalize proposing, voting for, and implementing changes to the functionality of the network. Once a proposal is submitted, holders of Tezos (XTZ) tokens can vote with a weighting of one vote per token. DLS released the source code in 2016 and used the codebase to launch an alphanet of the Tezos protocol in Feb. 2017, a few months before the Tezos token sale.\n\nTezos initial coin offering (ICO) and Foundation troubles\nThe Tezos <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/initial-coin-offering-ico\">initial coin offering (ICO)</a> launched on July 1, 2017, and the two-week sale managed to raise ~$232 million in Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\">$BTC</a>) and Ethereum (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\">$ETH</a>), exceeding the project's target of $20 million. It was the largest ICO at the time, surpassed by Filecoin's (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/filecoin\">$FIL</a>) ~$257 million token sale a few months later. The newly established Tezos Foundation, led by appointed president Johann Gevers, assumed control of the funds as well as the responsibility to deliver the sold tezzies to ICO contributors. The foundation, which did not include the Breitmans as board members for legal reasons, intended to use a portion of the funds to purchase Dynamic Ledger Solutions (DLS) from the Breitmans, a move that would transfer control of the Tezos codebase to the foundation.\n\nBefore the sale of DLS could take place, an internal dispute arose between the Breitmans and Gevers, leading to a delay in the distribution of XTZ tokens to investors. In response, angry investors launched several class-action lawsuits targeting Tezos and DLT, adding further delays to the protocol's development and token issuance event. The internal dispute ran its course by mid-Feb. 2018, when Gevers and another involved foundation member left their positions.\n\nMainnet launch\nThe foundation's early troubles caused the development team to miss its initial 2017 launch date. After the resolution, protocol development resumed, enabling the Tezos Foundation to release a betanet in June 2018. Once it completed a testing period on the betanet, the foundation launched the Tezos mainnet in Sept. 2018.\n\nThe launch introduced a new version of a <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-stake\">Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)</a> consensus model. Token holders can participate in consensus by locking up their tokens in exchange for the ability to validate blocks. The industry commonly refers to this process as <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/staking'\">staking</a>, but the Tezos community uses the synonymous term \"baking.\" The Tezos design expands on traditional PoS systems by enabling users to \"delegate\" tokens to bakers without transferring ownership. In this self-described \"liquid\" PoS model, a baker receives a block reward in the form of new XTZ tokens with a proportional amount of this reward distributed to users that delegated tokens to the baker. This system enables smaller token holders to participate in the validation (and reward) process if they hold less than the required amount to become a full baker.", "issuing_organizations": [{"slug": "tezos-foundation", "name": "Tezos Foundation", "logo": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/Tezos%20Foundation.png", "description": "The Tezos Foundation helps guide the future direction and overall strategy of the Tezos protocol by managing the project's treasury and issuing grants to projects building on Tezos.

The allocation of funds is also overseen by the Swiss Federal Supervisory Authority and audited by PwC Switzerland.\n\nPer its [first biannual update released in Aug. 2019](https://tezos.foundation/news/tezos-foundation-releases-first-biannual-report), the foundation allocated $37.4 million in its inaugural year of operation. These grants helped fund 62 different entities or projects that the foundation separated into three dedicated sectors:\n- __$14.8 million__ to Research, Education, & Core Development to help support various researchers and engineers, as well as educational programs to train future talent\n- __$14.1 million__ to Community to support community development and events that help grow the Tezos

It also takes into account the new economic policy Elrond adopted following its mainnet launch in Jul. 2020. Elrond reduced the max supply of its native token by 1000x to 20 million. As part of the transition and token swap, ERD holders were able to exchange ERD for the Elrond's new native token, dubbed EGLD, at a rate of 1000:1.\n\nOngoing Emission (Staking Rewards)\nElrond features staking rewards to incentivize validator and delegator participation. Network contributors can increase their relative share of overall token holders by helping secure the network. Elrond will have a minimum guaranteed reward amount per year that decreases annually. This inflation rate should reach zero by the eleventh year post-mainnet launch. The hard cap on eGLD's annual issuance means Elrond must organically grow its fee market over the next decade to pay validators for their continued contributions.\n\nElrond's minimum guaranteed reward amount will come from fees while the rest will come from inflation. Therefore, the maximum inflation rate per year, if fees are zero, is as follows:\nYear 1: 10.8% (2,169,025 max supply that can be added)\nYear 2: 9.7% (1,940,707)\nYear 3: 8.6% (1,712,388)\nYear 4: 7.4% (1,484,070)\nYear 5: 6.3% (1,255,751)\nYear 6: 5.1% (1,027,433)\nYear 7: 4.0% (799,114)\nYear 8: 2.9% (570,796)\nYear 9: 1.7% (342,477)\nYear 10: 0.6% (114,159)\n\nIf the cumulative sum of fees during one year is higher than the minimum guaranteed rewards, the inflation rate will become zero, and the total rewards distributed will be higher than the minimum guaranteed rewards. Otherwise, total fees will decrease the inflation by the corresponding amount. Elrond's economic policy gives eGLD a theoretical max supply of 31,415,926 tokens, but since annual issuance is offset by transaction fees, eGLD's actual max supply may end up being less than theorized.\n\nThe calculation and distribution of rewards and fees are done at the end-of-epoch and added to the first block in the next epoch by the block proposers. For all blocks produced in a round by each shard, 10% of the block transaction fees go directly to the block proposer. The other 90% of all transaction fees of a block are added in a pool and are distributed to all validators at the end of the epoch. Only the block proposer takes 10% of the fees in the current block.\n\nThe Liquid Supply Curve above reflects the expected eGLD issuance schedule if there are no fees.\n\nProtocol Treasury\n10% of validator rewards and 10% of the fees are collected into a Protocol Treasury. The role of the treasury is to ensure the sustainable development of the Elrond ecosystem. Funds will eventually be spent based on the Elrond Governance model (Elrond's on-chain governance is a work in progress).\n\nLearn more:\nElrond Economics Paper\neGLD Design and Emission Schedule", "general_emission_type": "Inflationary", "precise_emission_type": "Decreasing Issuance", "is_capped_supply": true, "max_supply": 31415926}, "consensus": {"consensus_details": "Elrond uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) variation it calls Secure PoS. Elrond's purpose-built consensus mechanism selects validator nodes to produce blocks and complete the consensus process on specific shards.\n\nAt the beginning of each round, SPoS selects validators for consensus using a randomness source that is calculated from the previous block and signed by the consensus leader (block proposer) of the current round. The resulting signature will be the randomness source for the next round, and due to its reliance on the preceding block, it cannot be known more than one round in advance.\n\nIn each round, a new consensus group is selected to propose a block. But only one validator in the group will be the block proposer. The block proposer is the validator in the consensus group who's hash of the public key and randomization factor is the smallest. The block proposer will produce the block for the round, and the rest of the consensus group will validate and sign it. The time necessary for random selection of the consensus group is relatively short (around 100 ms). This efficiency is a consequence of the fact that consensus selection is deterministic once the randomness source is known, thus there is no communication requirement.\n\nThere may be a security advantage to keeping round time relatively short. SPoS is built on the premise that a malevolent actor cannot adapt faster than the timeframe allowed by a round in order to influence the block that will be proposed.\n\nLike other PoS methods, SPoS selects validator nodes for consensus based on the number of native tokens staked (in this case, EGLD) by their operators. Additionally, each validator has an individual rating score that is taken into account. A validator's stake alone may only influence, but not completely determine the selection for consensus. Rating expresses the past behavior of the specific validator and is taken into account during consensus selection: validators with a higher rating are more likely to be selected. The rating of a validator is recalculated at the end of each epoch, with a few specific exceptions when the rating is adjusted immediately.

Nodes inside the shard are randomly selected in the consensus group without the possibility of knowing the members more than a round in advance. Every epoch up to 1/3 of the nodes in every shard is reshuffled to other shards in order to prevent collusion.\nSecure randomness beacon with BLS signing makes the randomness source unpredictable\nElrond balances smart contracts in shards, enabling it to run multiple SCs in parallel, while the cross-shard calls are handled through an asynchronous cross-shard execution model\nFast finality for cross-shard transactions.

Lenders provide liquidity by depositing cryptocurrencies in a pool contract. Simultaneously, in the same contract, the pooled funds can be borrowed by placing collateral. Loans do not need to be individually matched, instead, they rely on the pooled funds, as well as the amounts borrowed and their collateral. This enables instant loans with characteristics based on the state of the pool.\n\nFlash Loans\nAave also allows loans to be taken out without any collateral by creating logic that if it's not repaid within the block time, the transaction gets reversed. These flash loans are designed to be used by developers to build tools that require capital for arbitrage, refinancing or liquidating purposes. An example would be if a user took out a loan on <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/maker\">Maker</a> and the collateral price dropped making it close to liquidation, they could use a flash loan to repay the Maker loan and receive their collateral back. They could then sell the collateral to repay the flash loan thus avoiding the liquidation penalty on Maker without ever needing to actually have the funds necessary for repayment.\n\nRate Switching\nAnother unique feature of Aave is that it allows borrowers to switch between fixed and floating interest rates. Interest rates in DeFi are traditionally volatile making it difficult to estimate the long-term cost of borrowing. If a user anticipates interest rates to rise they can switch their loan to fixed rate in order to lock in their borrowing costs for the future, and if they expect rates to decrease they can switch back to floating to then decrease their borrowing costs. There are two exceptions where the fixed rate can actually change and that is if the deposit earning rate increases above the fixed borrow rate because the system could get unstable by paying out more than its being paid. In that case, the fixed rate is rebalanced to the new stable rate. the other scenario which works in the borrower's favor is if the variable rate is lower than the fixed rate by 20%, the loan will automatically decrease to account for the difference. \n", "client_repositories": []}, "security": {"audits": [{"title": "Security Audit", "date": null, "type": null, "details": "Audited by Trail of

Bytecoin launched in March 2014; however, after a controversial 80% premine, a Bitcointalk forum user known as thankfulfortoday forked the codebase of Bytecoin into the a new project named BitMonero, a compound of Bit (as in Bitcoin) and Monero (meaning \"coin\" in Esperanto). \n\nThe release of BitMonero was poorly received by the community that initially backed it, leading seven community members to fork BitMonero into a new project called Monero. This largely pseudonymous group, led by Fluffypony (<a href=\"https://messari.io/person/riccardo-spagni\">Riccardo Spagni</a>), ultimately became the first Monero Core team. Monero launched its project in April 2014 with no premine. \n\nMonero's payment anonymity has garnered significant attention from a panoply of crypto-curious persons. Since its launch Monero has become one of the most widely used darknet currencies in the world due to its anonymity by default features. In 2017 Monero further enhanced its privacy features by incorporating Ring CT signatures, a solution proposed by Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell, that obscures transaction amounts for each entry in the ring signature, in addition to obscuring the transaction address. This provided near complete transaction anonymity in contrast to just sender anonymity as it was previously. In October 2018, Monero implemented bulletproofs, a <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/zero-knowledge-proofs\">zero-knowledge proof</a> technology that replaced the previous zero-knowledge range proofs that its confidential transactions relied on. Bulletproofs cut the size of its confidential transactions by at least 80 percent, significantly increasing transaction efficiency. \n\nMonero undergoes scheduled hard forks every six months intended to allow Monero to evolve at a regular cadence, while still leaving users enough time to update before being forked away from the network. These hard forks tend to include everything from patches and bug fixes to hashing algorithm changes and functionality upgrades.\n\nIn December 2019, Fluffypony (Riccardo Spagni), Monero's lead maintainer <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/monero-s-fluffypony-steps-down\">stepped down</a> from the project in an effort to further decentralize the project.

Consensus in Monero, and other systems using Nakamoto Conensus, is probabilistic because there is always a chance that a new, longer competing chain could emerge with more accumulated proof-of-work, that would invalidate the current chain.\n\nMining\nMiners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks using the RandomX proof-of-work algorithm. In this process, miners compete to generate a <a href=\"https://messari.io/blog/hash-function\">hash</a> less than the target number set by Monero's <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level\">difficulty adjustment algorithm</a>. The target difficulty level is adjusted every block.\n\nIn the pursuit of decentralization at the miner level, Monero periodically changes its proof-of-work algorithm via hard forks to ensure Monero remains ASIC resistant and open to individuals with commodity hardware. Like many proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, mining is now done in pools where participants contribute <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/hash-power\">hash power</a> to the pool and receive a proportional share of the profits if the pool finds a valid block. This is to smooth individuals' mining revenue as mining has become more competitive. \n\nBlock sizes in Monero are dynamic and there is no preset block size limit like there is in Bitcoin. However, despite there being no block size limits, Monero has a block reward penalty system that keeps block sizes in check. The block reward penalty system works first by taking the median size of the last 100 blocks. If a new block's size is greater than that median, then the block reward gets reduced quadratically depending on how much the new block size exceeds that median. The maximum block size is set at two times the median of the last 100 blocks, and as the block size approaches that limit the block reward approaches zero.

Economic nodes (aka \"full nodes\") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and double-spend vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.\n\nMining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a hash less than the target number set by Monero's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Monero uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated \u201cwork\u201d (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain. \n\nMonero runs a proof-of-work algorithm called RandomX, an algorithm using random code execution and memory-hard techniques for ASIC resistance. Monero initiates hard forks every 6 months to implement upgrades to the protocol, often times changing its PoW algorithm to prevent ASICs from joining the network.\n\nMonero's privacy enhancements stem from ring signatures, which mask sender identities and offers single-use keys to make transactions untraceable. Ring signatures merge a group of signers together to better preserve the anonymity of the true signer. The group is comprised of the actual signers single use key initiating the transaction and past transaction outputs from Monero\u2019s blockchain. Including past transaction outputs helps preserve the senders anonymity because they are theoretically indistinguishable to an outside observer as the valid transaction itself. \n\nIn January 2017, Monero implemented Ring Confidential Transactions (Ring CTs) in an effort to combat concerns around the true degree of anonymity offered by Monero. Ring signatures only provided privacy for the sender of the transaction, and required outputs to be broken up into separate rings because ring signatures could only contain outputs of the same value. Ring CT signatures aimed to alleviate these concerns by obscuring transaction amounts for each entry in the ring signature, in addition to obscuring the transaction address. With Ring CTs wallets could arbitrarily select ring members from any output size. To prove that certain amounts were spent, Ring CTs used range proofs, a <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/zero-knowledge-proofs\">zero knowledge cryptography</a> technique used to prove the amount used in a transaction with revealing the details. \n\nHowever, the range proofs used in Monero's confidential transactions to ensure the integrity of transactions, were computationally intensive, leading the Monero blockchain to bloat due to the onerous data requirements of each transaction. Thus, in October 2018 Monero implemented bulletproofs, which addressed this scalability issue, cutting the size of its confidential transactions by at least 80 percent and significantly increasing transaction efficiency. Bulletproofs are a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof that does not require a trusted setup. Bulletproofs aggregate information into new data structures that scale logarithmically, rather than linearly, allowing even greater scaling for larger transactions that contain multiple outputs.", "client_repositories": []}, "security": {"audits": [], "known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities": []}}, "governance": {"governance_details": "Monero protocol development involves a proposal process whereby anyone in the open source Monero community can submit proposals for improving the Monero protocol. After debate by the community, when consensus has emerged, the Monero Core maintainers merge code changes into Monero Core's GitHub Repository. Once new code has been implemented into the Monero Core client, users of the network (full nodes) must be persuaded to adopt the new changes. Protocol changes are \u201cratified\u201d on-chain when the majority of the network adopts the upgrade and doesn\u2019t break consensus.\n\nMonero funds protocol development through its Forum Funding System (FFS), a donation based crowdfunding system. The FFS is a system whereby anyone can propose ideas and request anonymous donations to fund development work. Once proposals have been funded, funds are released as certain milestones are reached.    \n\nMonero opts for scheduled hard forks every six months. The community believes that not only does this ensure the protocol is continuously being improved at a regular cadence, but it also keeps the community engaged in the governance process.

Indexers earn query fees and indexer rewards for their services.\n\nCurators are subgraph developers, data consumers or community members who signal to Indexers which APIs should be indexed by The Graph Network. Curators deposit GRT into a bonding curve to signal on a specific subgraph and earn a portion of query fees for the subgraphs they signal on; incentivizing the highest quality data sources. Curators will curate on subgraphs and deposit GRT via the Graph Explorer dApp. Because this occurs on a bonding curve, that means that earlier signals gain greater share of the query fees on that subgraph for a given amount of GRT deposited. \n\nDelegators are individuals who would like to contribute to securing the network but do not want to run a Graph Node themselves. Delegators contribute by delegating GRT to existing Indexers and they earn a portion of query fees and indexing rewards in return. Delegators select Indexers based on their performance on measures like query fee rates, past slashing and uptime as well as delegator parameters like the cut of fees and rewards from the Indexer. Delegators will delegate and undelegate GRT on Indexers via the Graph Explorer dApp.\n\nConsumers are the end-users of The Graph that query subgraphs and pay query fees to the Indexers, Curators and Delegators. Consumers are likely to be developers or projects themselves that cover query fees for their applications as they would AWS or cloud service costs. However, some applications will pass on query fees to users or bundle the cost in product fees. Consumers will pay for query fees via \u201cgateways\u201d or wallets that will be built on top of open source contracts in The Graph Network.\n\nIndexers that stake GRT operate in a query marketplace where they earn query fees for indexing services and serving queries to subgraphs - like serving Uniswap trade data on Uniswap.info. The price of these queries will be set by Indexers and vary based on cost to index the subgraph, the demand for queries, the amount of curation signal and the market rate for blockchain queries. Since Consumers (ie. applications) are paying for queries, the aggregate cost is expected to be much lower than the costs of running a server and database.\n\nA Gateway can be used to allow consumers to connect to the network and to facilitate payments. The team behind The Graph will initially run a set of gateways that allows applications to cover the query costs on behalf of their users. These gateways facilitate connecting to The Graph Network. Anyone will be able to run their own gateways as well. Gateways handle state channel logistics for query fees, and route to Indexers as a function of price, performance and security that is predetermined by the application paying for those queries.\n\nIn addition to query fees, Indexers and Delegators will earn indexing rewards in the form of GRT that is new token issuance distributed proportional to Curator signal and allocated stake. Indexing rewards will start at 3% annually. Future GRT monetary policy will be set by an independent technical governance which will be established as after network launch.\n\nThe Graph Network will have epochs which are measured in blocks and are used for the Indexing Rewards calculations.\n\nIn addition to query fees and indexing rewards, there is a Rebate Pool that rewards all network participants based on their contributions to The Graph Network. The rebate pool is designed to encourage Indexers to allocate stake in rough proportion to the amount of query fees they earn for the network.\n\nGRT that is staked in the protocol is subject to a thawing period and can be slashed if Indexers are malicious and serve incorrect data to applications or if they index incorrectly. Curators and Delegators cannot be slashed for bad behavior, yet there is a withdrawal tax on Curators and Delegators to disincentivize poor decision making that could harm the integrity of the network. Curators also earn fewer query fees if they choose to curate on a low-quality subgraph, since there will be fewer queries to process or fewer indexers to process those queries.\n\nA portion of protocol query fees are burned, expected to start at ~1% of total protocol query fees and subject to future technical governance. The aforementioned withdrawal tax that is incurred by Curators and Delegators withdrawing their GRT is also burned, as well as any unclaimed rebate rewards.", "general_consensus_mechanism": "Proof-of-Stake", "precise_consensus_mechanism": null, "targeted_block_time": null, "block_reward": null, "mining_algorithm": null, "next_halving_date": null, "is_victim_of_51_percent_attack": null}}, "native_treasury": {"accounts": [], "treasury_usage_details": null}}, "technology": {"overview": {"technology_details": "The Graph learns what and how to index Ethereum data based on subgraph descriptions, known as the subgraph manifest. The subgraph description defines the smart contracts of interest for a subgraph, the events in those contracts to pay attention to, and how to map event data to data that The Graph will store in its database.\n\nSubgraph\nA subgraph is defined by a subgraph manifest, which is immutable and stored on IPFS. The immutability is important for having deterministic and reproducible queries for verification and dispute resolution. The GNS performs a much needed role by allowing teams to attach a name to a subgraph, which can then be used to point to consecutive immutable subgraph \u201cversions.\u201d\n\nIndexer Staking\nIndexers must stake Graph Tokens in order to sell their services in the query market. This serves two primary functions:\n\n1) It provides economic security, as the staked GRT can be slashed if Indexers perform their work maliciously. Once GRT is staked, it may only be withdrawn subject to a thawing period, which provides ample opportunity for verification and dispute resolution.\n\n2) It provides a _Sybil resistance _mechanism. Having fake or low quality Indexers on a given subgraph makes it slower to find quality service providers. For this reason The Graph only wants Indexers who have skin in the game to be discoverable.\n\nThe Graph will implement an incentive model pioneered by the team at 0x. It involves collecting a protocol fee on all transactions in the protocol, and then rebating those fees to participants as a function of their proportional stake and proportional fees collected for the network, using the Cobb-Douglas production function.\n\nCurator Signaling\nCurator signaling is the process of depositing GRT into a bonding curve for a subgraph to indicate to Indexers that the subgraph should be indexed.\nIndexers can trust the signal because when curators deposit GRT into the bonding curve, they mint curation signal for the respective subgraph, entitling them to a portion of future query fees collected on that subgraph. A rationally self-interested curator should signal GRT toward subgraphs that they predict will generate fees for the network.\nUsing bonding curves\u2014a type of algorithmic market maker where price is determined by a function\u2014means that the more curation signal are minted, the higher the exchange rate between GRT and curation signal becomes. Thus, successful curators could take profits immediately if they feel that the value of future curation fees has been correctly priced in. Similarly, they should withdraw their GRT if they feel that the market has priced the value of curation signal too high.\n\nIndexer Inflation Reward\nThis reward is intended to incentivize Indexers to index subgraphs that don\u2019t yet have significant query volume. This helps to solve the bootstrapping problem for new subgraphs, which may not have pre-existing demand to attract Indexers.\n\nEach subgraph in the network is allotted a portion of the total network inflation reward, based on the proportional amount of total curation signal that subgraph has. That amount, in turn, is divided between all the Indexers staked on that subgraph proportional to their amount of contributed stake.\n\nDuring the bootstrapping phase, there is an incentive for Indexers to stake but not actually do the work of indexing and serving queries on any subgraphs.There will be an indexer monitoring service which is set via protocol governance. This service has the authority to add Indexers to a blacklist if they are found to be unavailable for serving queries on the subgraphs they are staked on.\n\nGraph Explorer & Graph Name Service\nGraph Explorer will be a dApp, built on top of a subgraph that indexes the Graph Protocol smart contracts\u2014including the Graph Name Service (GNS), an on-chain registry of subgraphs.\n\nThe subgraph, along with other metadata stored in the GNS, allows users of Graph Explorer to get a better sense for the purpose and possible utility of a subgraph in a way that a random string of alphanumeric characters and compiled WASM byte code does not.\nRather than simply letting dApps build on multiple separate subgraphs, subgraph composition will allow brand new subgraphs to be built that directly reference entities from existing subgraphs. This reuse of the same subgraphs across many dApps and other subgraphs is one of the core efficiencies that The Graph unlocks.\n\nConditional Micropayments\nThe Graph Network will utilize state channels with \u2018hub and spoke topology\u2019 to minimize trust between the consumer and the Indexer.\n\nThis means that in order to use The Graph a consumer will need to have a state channel open on-chain with the state channel hub, which is loaded with their preferred stable token or ETH. The Indexers, meanwhile, will also need to have a state channel open with the hub where they can receive GRT.\n\nThe state channel hub will be collateralized with GRT and be responsible for setting the exchange rate between the payment denomination and GRT so that all micropayments are settled in the same unit of account.\n\nVerification\nIn order for the WAVE Locks construction and indexer staking to be meaningful, there must be an effective verification mechanism that is capable of reproducing the work performed by an Indexer, identifying faults and slashing offending Indexers.\n\nIn the first phase of The Graph Network, this is handled through an on-chain dispute resolution process, which is decided through arbitration.\n\nFishermen submit disputes along with a bond, as well as an attestation signed by an Indexer. If the Indexer is found to have attested to an incorrect query response, the fisherman receives a portion of the slashed amount as a reward. Conversely, the fisherman\u2019s bond is forfeit if the dispute is unsuccessful.\n\nInitially, in the early days there will be a fisherman service where consumers may post attestations, and the Graph will take on the responsibility of verifying query responses and submitting disputes on-chain. Additionally, there will be an arbitration service set via protocol governance, which will act as the sole arbitrator in the dispute resolution", "client_repositories": []}, "security": {"audits": [],

What made it different at the time of launch was that PancakeSwap was built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which offers faster and cheaper transactions compared to Ethereum. At the time of PancakeSwap's launch, Ethereum was suffering from expensive and slow transactions as DeFi's mainstream moment in 2020 drove massive demand for transactions. Almost all DeFi applications lived on Ethereum at the time.\n\nAside from cheaper network fees powered by BSC, PancakeSwap also offered a lower swap fee of 0.2% while the industry standard is 0.3%. On the back of its low-fee model, PancakeSwap saw rapid growth in both trading volume and total value locked (TVL). It became one of the industry's largest decentralized exchanges by trading volume in February 2021, standing toe-to-toe with AMM pioneer and Ethereum darling Uniswap.\n\nTowards a Diversified DeFi Institution\nThanks to cheaper network fees, strong branding, and the delivery of new and innovative features, PancakeSwap has experienced a meteoric rise in total value locked (TVL) in 2021.  PancakeSwap plans to expand its purview into prediction markets, lending and borrowing, and margin trading.

Typically, centralized exchanges function by using an order-book where market participants post limit orders at which they are willing to buy and sell an asset, and market makers fill these orders with the intention of earning a return on the spread. PancakeSwap does away entirely with the order book and instead opts to have liquidity providers deposit assets into a pool that traders can then trade against. The price is determined algorithmically based on the proportion of the two assets being traded.\n\nPrice Mechanism\nPancakeSwap uses what's known as a Constant Product Market Maker that is designed to always provide liquidity regardless of the order size or amount of funds in the pool. This is achieved by asymptotically increasing the price as the size of the buy order increases, leading to potentially significant slippage on large orders. Trading pools consist of two tokens, with the product between the two sums remaining constant. Any given transaction increases one sum while decreasing the other and the price changes based on the ratio between the two. \n\nProviding Liquidity\nWhen liquidity providers add to a pool, they receive newly minted liquidity provider (LP) tokens entitling them to their proportion of the total pool as well as the 0.17% fee generated off each trade. PancakeSwap Treasury receives the remaining 0.03% from the 0.20% charged on every trade. Liquidity tokens keep track of how much of the pool is owed. Liquidity providers need to supply both assets in the same proportion they are currently at, otherwise, they will change the ratio and thus price. This would result in the immediate loss of money as the price change should get arbitraged out by trading bots. Even if providers supply the correct ratio of each asset, large price changes can result in the loss of money, also known as impermanent loss. Therefore, providers are hoping for substantial volume of trading around the price they entered such that the fees generated account for any potential losses.", "client_repositories": []}, "security": {"audits": [{"title": "Security Audit", "date": "2020-10-13T00:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": "Security research firm CertiK ran an audit of PancakeSwap's codebase from 10/5/2020 to 10/13/2020.

The project competes with other popular smart contract platforms such as Ethereum (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\">$ETH</a>), NEO (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/neo\">$NEO</a>), and Cardano (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/cardano\">$ADA</a>). EOS tries to differentiate itself by providing transaction throughput capable of handling thousands of transactions per second without having to pay direct fees, improved usability for all parties involved, and governance for business and chain maintenance.\n\nEOS makes use of <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/on-chain-governance\">on-chain governance</a> whereby token holders can vote for the block producers (BPs) as well as various upgrades to the protocol, monetary policy, or stakeholder bylaws. The EOS User Agreement defines and enforces the user bylaws. The rules are not enforceable at the protocol level but rather act as a terms-of-service agreement that users must agree to. This community developed agreement replaced Block.one's Constitution by a majority BP vote back in April 2019.\n\nEcosystem funds play an important role in the growth and adoption of EOS. Their mandate is to make strategic investments that increase the value of the projects and tokens to ensure the necessary infrastructure is built and proper incentivization exists to attract developers to build on the platform. The most prominent is a $325 million fund ran by <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/michael-novogratz\">Mike Novogratz</a> called Galaxy Digital EOS VC.", "issuing_organizations": [{"slug": "block-one", "name": "Block.one", "logo": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1581552000%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DtPU1_MvQ33Slla6NbjCp087tJn-Mutz_IyntLFZLBTI", "description": "Block.one is a software publisher that introduces a blockchain architecture designed to enable vertical and horizontal scaling of decentralized applications.

While BPs must share a smaller piece of the total reward pool, there are only 21 BPs; thus, they receive more daily EOS rewards on average than their counterparts. Standby Producers represent potential block producers ranked outside of the top 21 that have enough voting support from token holders to receive a minimum daily reward of 100 EOS.\n\nHistoric supply and inflation changes\nAt launch, the inflation rate for EOS was 5%, but this metric was somewhat misleading as the network routed 4% of newly minted tokens into the eosio.saving account. The supply directed to this account was illiquid and only accessible by way of a successful vote among the network's 21 block producers (BPs). The rest of the outstanding inflation went to BPs and Standby Producers per the same percentage breakdown described above.\n\nBPs can also vote on decreasing or increasing the inflation rate. Therefore, these network representatives can impact the future supply of EOS by altering the block reward or changing the contents of the eosio.saving account, an act that has happened twice since inception.\n\nOn May 8, 2019, BPs opted to burn all of the tokens collected in the eosio.saving account up until that point, which amounted to 34 million EOS. The inflation rate remained intact, however, so that account continued to accrue 80% of the newly issued (but still illiquid) EOS supply.\n\nIn Feb. 2020, fifteen of the twenty-one BPs voted again to burn the over 34 million EOS tokens (worth almost $140 million at the time) held in the eosio.saving account. This vote also reduced the inflation rate of the network from 5% to its current rate of 1%. This inflation reduction only eliminated the 80% of block rewards previously dedicated to the eosio.saving account, effectively eliminating the role of that account on the network. Since the contents of the eosio.saving account were already illiquid, the vote's impact on the circulating supply and real inflation rate was minimal.\n\nBlock.one vesting schedule\nBlock.one allocated itself 100 million EOS tokens at launch to fund future ecosystem development. These tokens will unlock linearly every second over a period of ten years starting from the network's Genesis Block on Jun. 6, 2018. In May 2019, Block.one claimed a vested batch of 9.8 million EOS and used 3.3 million of these tokens (worth ~$25 million at the time) to purchase network RAM. The firm now only holds the current and future rights to 96.7 million EOS tokens.\n\nImpact of the eosio.ramfee account\nUntil May 1, 2019, and the launch of Resource Exchange (REX) on EOS Mainnet, the fees collected from RAM trading (0.5% of the value of each trade) were sent and stored on the eosio.ramfee account.  From May 1, 2019, the fees are now directly transferred from the eosio.ramfee to the REX, but the funds (approximately 2M EOS) that were located in the eosio.ramfee account before the upgrade will not be allocated to the REX and remain illiquid. \n\nBlacklisted accounts\nEOSIO also has a feature that allows Block Producers to blacklist accounts. All the Block Producers need to blacklist an account in order for the blacklist to happen. Those blacklisted accounts' supply is considered illiquid since it is no longer transferable.

As a result, network activity spiked as users rushed to acquire the new token and flip it on exchanges like MXC Exchange that listed an EIDOS/a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/tether\"$USDT/a trading pair. The rise in activity caused EOS to enter \u201ccongestion mode,\u201d which limits the number of transactions a user can submit \u201cto their pro-rata share\u201d of total staked EOS resources. Coinbase also reported 95% of all EOS actions since Oct. 31 were related to the EIDOS contract.\n\nLearn more a href=\"https://messari.io/article/the-eidos-airdrop-is-clogging-the-eos-blockchain\"here/a"}]}}, "governance": {"governance_details": "EOS protocol upgrade and code changes are subject to its on-chain governance system. Anyone is free to submit new policies or code changes, but these proposals must achieve a majority vote before being accepted into the codebase. The decision-making process for EOS' on-chain governance is well-defined; however, governance debates, which can influence on-chain decisions, still occur off-chain. The strict on-chain rules often increase the activity of off-chain politics, as various stakeholders engage in community discussions surrounding any new proposals or ongoing voting sessions.", "onchain_governance": {"onchain_governance_type": "Delegated On-Chain Vote", "onchain_governance_details": "EOS features on-chain governance that processes voting through its delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) system. Similar to how EOS stakeholders vote on block producers, this model allows token holders to vote on protocol decisions that are automatically implemented or rejected depending on the final vote tally. Votes are weighted by the number of tokens held, and holders can opt to delegate their votes to another holder on their behalf. Protocol decisions can consist of changes to the system parameters, updates to the User Agreement, or alterations on the inflation rate, among others.\n\n__EOS Constitution replaced for the new User Agreement__\nBlock.one initially instituted a [Constitution](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/blob/5068823fbc8a8f7d29733309c0496438c339f7dc/constitution.md) (now outdated) for the protocol, which consisted of various articles defining how users, developers, and validators should act on-chain. It served [as the](https://multicoin.capital/2018/04/24/eos-analysis-and-valuation/) \"terms of service agreement in the software that bound stakeholders together through a set of bylaws.\" While well-intentioned, the Constitutional ran into some early roadblocks. Dan Larimer even proposed a new version that looked to remove the Arbitration Forum/establishment of the block producers as the jury and implement a supermajority vote required to freeze any account or contract, among other clarifications.\n\nDespite Larimer's contribution, the community opted to develop its own solution, resulting in an open-source governance framework dubbed the EOS User Agreement. BPs [approved](https://steemit.com/eos/@lukestokes/the-eos-user-agreement-is-live) the User Agreement by a majority vote (15/21), and the agreement officially replaced the old Constitution in April 2019.\n\nLearn more about the User Agreement and its eleven articles [here](https://github.com/eosnewyork/eosuseragreement/blob/master/README.md)\n\n__Governance Resources__\n[EOS Titan Voting

Staking rewards begin accruing after November 2, 2020 and are paid out every epoch (approximately weekly).\n\nLong Term\nNew issuance on Flow is used for staking rewards in cases when transaction fees are not sufficient to compensate delegators and validator node operators.

Flow pipelines the work of a blockchain miner or validator across four different roles that all require staking; a separation of concerns that significantly reduces redundant effort. Epochs will reflect the plans outlined in this document - Incentives in a Multi-Role Blockchain while challenge arbitration will in Flow is described in this technical paper - Execution Verification. \n\nResource-oriented programming\nSmart contracts on Flow are written in Cadence, a new programming language for cryptoassets and apps that builds on the concepts of resource-oriented programming which prioritizes ease of use for developers. Using Cadence, developers will be able to create unique and durable digital artifacts where ownership is tracked by the language itself. Flow envisions that this design will enable a powerful new category of applications. Developers can try Cadence on the Flow Playground.\n\nDeveloper ergonomics\nFlow includes a number of features informed by Dapper Labs\u2019 experience building some of the most used dapps of all time, including CryptoKitties. For example, Flow enables upgradeable smart contracts to allow developers to deploy smart contracts to the mainnet in a \u201cbeta state\u201d, where the code can be incrementally updated by the original authors. Users will be alerted to the unfinished nature of this code, and can choose to wait until the code is finalized before interacting with it. Once authors are confident that their code is safe, they can irrevocably release their control on the contract, and then remains immutable on the Flow blockchain for all time. This balances the best-practices of product development (early iteration and refinement) with the smart contract benefits of trustless, immortal code.\n\nConsumer onboarding\nThe native account model on Flow is designed to provide a series of benefits to improve the experience for all users, from rank beginners to seasoned experts. For example, there are hooks built into the protocol to allow account recovery flows for users who lose their keys and optional multi-sig support with the ability to frequently cycle keys for advanced use cases.\n\nGeneral Tech stack overview\nThe entirety of the node software is currently written in the Go programming language. This includes basic storage (BadgerDB), networking (libp2p), consensus algorithm (self implemented HotStuff), execution storage (self implemented binary Merkle tree), execution environment (Cadence) and all supporting components.\n\nThe codebase is generally split into sections related to each of the roles: Access, Collection, Consensus, Execution and Verification, with the exception being shared components, such as caching, networking and cryptography.\n\nThe Flow blockchain programming language, Cadence lives in a separate repo and is maintained separately.", "client_repositories": []}, "security": {"audits": [], "known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities": []}}, "governance": {"governance_details": "The Flow Blockchain is governed in a progressively decentralized manner in which no single party carries an outsized influence over the direction of the network.

The Flow GitHub repository is currently under the control of the Core Team.\nMembers of the Flow Ecosystem discuss a submitted proposal; during this process, anyone may propose modifications to the originally submitted proposal\nEventually, it is determined whether there is community consensus to implement a given proposal\nIf and once community consensus forms around a proposal, the Core Team authorizes and implements the changes in a set of compatible protocol definitions and software implementations so they can be deployed by Validators maintaining the Flow Blockchain.

The project aimed to develop a new efficient micro processor for IoT devices based on trinary (rather than binary) calculation methods. In order to finance R&D of the hardware project, the Jinn team held a crowd sale for in September 2014, selling ~100,000 JINN tokens (10% of the total) for 8,5000,000 <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/nxt\">NXT</a> worth $250,000 at the time. The JINN tokens were launched on the NXT platform and represented a share in the profits of the Jinn company. \n\nHowever, fearing regulatory issues surrounding their JINN, which represented a claim on the Jinn's profits, the Jinn team pivoted. On a BitcoinTalk forum in 2015, the Jinn founders announced a new project called IOTA. IOTA aimed to be \"a brand new and novel micro-transaction cryptotoken optimized for the Internet-of-Things (IoT).\" According to Jinn founder S\u00f8nsteb\u00f8, \"...it only makes sense first to introduce IOTA and then Jinn afterwards.\" \n\nIOTA Crowdsale\nThe team similarly did a crowdsale for their IOTA token, which instead of being a profit sharing token like JINN, was a utility token used for payment on the IOTA network. IOTA sold 999,999,999 tokens in its 2015 crowdsale raising a total of 1,337 Bitcoin, equivalent to $434,000 at the time. Jinn token holders were also allowed to participate in the IOTA crowdsale by converting their JINN tokens for IOTA at a fixed exchange rate of 0.0063BTC per JINN. The supply was later changed to 2.78 billion IOTA. According to IOTA documentation the token supply was increased because \u201chigh supply makes IOTA optimal for tiny nano transactions while still keeping efficiency in mind.\u201c 5% of the funds from the IOTA's token offering were later donated to the IOTA Foundation, which was formally announced in October 2017.\n\nMainnet Launch\nIn July 2016, IOTA launched on Mainet. The project aimed to provide distributed ledger technology for the internet-of-things (IoT) space where small connected devices regularly share data. Because these devices are generally specialized to be low power and application specific IOTA does not use a traditional consensus mechanism like proof-of-work or proof-of-stake nor does it use a blockchain structure. The goal of the project is to allow these devices to conduct micropayment transactions between themselves and potentially to securely transfer data. \n\nAt the core of the project is what is referred to as the 'Tangle,' a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that acts as the public ledger system. The team believes that this structure will allow for feeless payments, lower compute cost, and the ability to connect to billions of devices. The efficiency of this system also grows as the number of participants increases as transactions will be processed at a faster rate. One of the project's more recent releases was a data marketplace that allows for storing and selling data streams while masking the source of the data.\n\nIOTA is currently developed and supported by the IOTA foundation, a German non-profit. In July 2019, Iota co-founder Sergey Ivancheglo stepped down from the IOTA Foundation.", "issuing_organizations": []}, "roadmap": [{"title": "Iota roadmap", "date": null, "type": null, "details": "https://roadmap.iota.org/"}], "regulation": {"regulatory_details": null, "sfar_score": null, "sfar_summary": null}}, "contributors": {"individuals": [{"slug": "john-licciardello-52499945", "first_name": "John ", "last_name": "Licciardello\t", "title": "Managing Director of IOTA's Ecosystem Development Fund", "description": "Managing Director of IOTA's Ecosystem Development Fund", "avatar_url": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1551312000%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3Dy_rixvgDK-hyS8UvXKaYqTp7FyvMss_nFs7LhFTGDpM"}, {"slug": "dominik-schiener", "first_name": "Dominik ", "last_name": "Schiener\t", "title": "Founder and Board Co-Chairman at IOTA", "description": "Founder and Board Co-Chairman at IOTA", "avatar_url": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/OdDSqSfD_400x400.jpg"}, {"slug": "david-s-nsteb", "first_name": "David ", "last_name": "S\u00f8nsteb\u00f8\t", "title": "Founder and Board Co-Chairman at IOTA", "description": "Founder and Board Co-Chairman at IOTA", "avatar_url": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/12734714%3Fs%3D460%26v%3D4"}, {"slug": "serguei-popov", "first_name": "Serguei ", "last_name": "Popov\t", "title": "Founder and Board Member at IOTA", "description": "Founder and Board Member at IOTA", "avatar_url": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1551312000%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3Dh7zJQXjE91G-JcWQ0BkW6b4zN1z19pcSH_wenpqnEgY"}], "organizations": [{"slug": "iota-foundation", "name": "IOTA Foundation", "logo": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1590019200%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DG6iv0smcq2tXaFpm86UvLubXf_-IK_3UvVngUupw4Do", "description": "IOTA Foundation is a non-profit organization and creator of the Tangle, a permissionless, multi-dimensional distributed ledger, designed as a foundation of a global protocol for all things connected.

In the Tangle there are no blocks or miners, and every transaction on the Iota network must validate two previous transactions through a small proof-of-work (PoW). Therefore, users who issue a transactions are contributing to the network's security. Transaction on IOTA are stored in the tangle graph, which is the ledger for storing transactions.  \n\nThe main idea of the tangle is the following: to issue a transaction, users must work to approve other transactions. Once transactions are confirmed, they are broadcast to the entire network, where another unconfirmed transaction can decided to approve the newly confirmed transaction. It is assumed that the nodes check if the approved transactions are not conflicting. If a node \fadds that a transaction is in conflict with the tangle history, the node will not approve the conflicting transaction in either a direct or indirect manner. As transactions receive additional approvals, they are accepted by the system with a higher level of confidence.  \n\nApprovals add \"weight\" to a transaction. The weight of a transaction is proportional to the amount of work that the issuing node invested into it. it. Transactions with larger weights are more important than transactions with a smaller weight. Transactions accumulate weight over time. A transaction's cumulative weight is the weight of the transaction plus the sum of weights of all transactions that directly or indirectly approve this transaction. The time is takes for transactions to get approved is inversely proportional to the amount transactions being issued on the network. Once transactions are approved their weight will grow at the rate of the incoming flow of transactions. \n\nAlthough not mentioned in the whitepaper, the IOTA network currently relies on a coordinator node that provides trusted milestone transactions, and snapshots which are used to reduce the size of the network. The coordinator node is a special node that is operated by the IOTA foundation designed to protect the IOTA network from attacks while it grows.

Occurring roughly every month, snapshots aim to reduce the size of the IOTA network, preventing it from bloating. Full Nodes in IOTA only store the history up to the latest Snapshot.\n\nIOTA plans to remove the coordinator once the network reaches scale. Furthermore, it eventually plans to incentivize full nodes to store the entire Tangle history beyond snapshots issued by the IOTA foundation.  \n", "client_repositories": [{"name": "Iota", "link": "https://github.com/iotaledger", "license_type": "MIT License"}]}, "security": {"audits": [], "known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities": [{"title": "Curl Hash Function Vulnerability", "date": "2017-09-07T04:00:00Z", "type": "Cryptographic Hashing Algorithm", "details": "https://github.com/mit-dci/tangled-curl/blob/master/vuln-iota.md"}]}}, "governance": {"governance_details": "The IOTA Foundation is primarily responsible for funding and leading development of IOTA.

This model aims to prevent the centralization of staked towards the top of the Validator Set.\n\nThe Harmony protocol also includes built-in penalties to punish undesired validator behavior, such as double-signing or falling offline when called upon.\nDouble Signing: A validator that gets caught double-signing a proposed block will receive a minimum 2% slashing penalty on their stake. The slashing increases linearly as the number of validators being slashed at the same time (e.g. 33% slashing if 1/3 of the validators double signing)\nUnavailability: At the end of each epoch, validators that couldn't maintain at least a 67% uptime will have their status set to \u201cInactive\u201d and be ruled out from the new election.

This divide and conquer approach can accelerate system performance and transaction validation speeds. Harmony divides not only our network nodes but also the blockchain state into shards. This model can lower the hardware requirements for prospective node operators.\n\nEach Harmony shard will eventually have 250 nodes to help deter single shard attacks. The more nodes per shard, the more difficult it can be to exploit the network. The protocol also uses a Verifiable Random Function (VDF) to randomly select shard membership, thus making it more challenging for a group of nodes to coordinate an attack.\n\nPBFT consensus\nHarmony uses Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) to support \"fast consensus of block transactions.\" The project says this Fast BFT (FBFT) model allows it to reach finality (the likelihood a transaction ends up in an uncle or orphan block) after one block.

Pecksheild reportedly found two issues.\n\nThe first issue is related to the missed validity and sanity checks when a cross-shard receipt is first received by a node. This issue allows a malicious attacker to send invalid cross-shard receipts and prevent valid receipts from being processed in time, thus it is classified as medium severity. We immediately fixed this issue after receiving the initial report ([code of the fix](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony/pull/2051)).\n\nThe second issue is on the missing penalty when the leader does not process cross-shard receipts. In general, this issue falls under the problem of transaction censorship for any blockchains. The solution to this issue on Harmony includes:\n1. Leader rotation\n2. A Mechanism to detect malicious leader and switch to the next leader with our view change protocol.\n\nThese two solutions are planned in the next phase of the mainnet upgrade as it moves towards decentralization.

Validating nodes are randomly selected to confirm on-chain transactions by a collective of book-keeping nodes, which mimics the consensus mechanism of protocols like Stellar in some ways. Chain hard forks are more more complicated under dBFT consensus than Proof of Work (PoW), for example. Users cannot fork the chain at will like under PoW consensus since dBFT requires a two-thirds user majority to operate. \n\nNEO also supports two native tokens: NEO and NeoGas (GAS). NEO is a payments token that also confers governance rights over the network's changes and development. GAS is a fuel token for the NEO virtual machine useful for executing smart contracts and supporting applications built on NEO.

The founding team launched the network to address the shortcomings of existing blockchain platforms, which had limited business adoption up to that point. Consequently, Waves focused on speed, scalability, security and user experience.\n\nThe Waves network was launched in Q3 2016 with the ability to facilitate token creation and the management of digital tokens. In 2017, Waves started a collaboration with Microsoft Azure and became an official partner of Deloitte. It also implemented a new consensus protocol, Waves-NG, based on Cornell professor Emin G\u00fcn Sirer\u2019s Bitcoin-NG proposal, towards the end of the year. Waves-NG increased transaction throughput up to 100 tx/second. In 2018, the company released a new mobile application, which made most of Waves' most popular features available for smartphone and tablet users.\n\nToday, the platform offers purpose-designed tools to facilitate the process of developing and running dApps, and hosts various applications and use cases \u2013 from a <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-exchanges\">decentralized exchange (DEX</a>) and algorithmic <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/stablecoins\">stablecoins</a> to <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/dao\">DAOs</a>, encrypted messaging, and gaming.", "issuing_organizations": []}, "roadmap": [{"title": "Smart Assets and Smart Account Trading", "date": "2018-12-13T05:00:00Z", "type": "Network Change", "details": "Waves released Node v0.15.3 introducing the Smart Assets and Smart Account Trading features onto mainnet.

The consensus mechanism also features a community-driven monetary policy, with block rewards decided by forgers and an activation protocol to vote on new features being launched onto the network.\n\nThe Waves-NG protocol, adapted from Emin G\u00fcn Sirer\u2019s Bitcoin-NG proposal, was implemented on mainnet in 2017 to enhance transaction throughput and reduce latencies. Unlike Ethereum (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\">$ETH</a>), Waves transactions have fixed fees and no variable gas-like requirements.\n\nRide, Waves\u2019 smart contract programming language, was inspired by Scala and created specifically for dApp development. Ride is a non-Turing complete and human-readable language equipped with Formal Verification and designed to make the process of learning and development faster. The incorporation of Formal Verification is meant to protect developers from various common mistakes which can lead to unintended consequences in <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/smart-contracts\">smart contracts</a> and potential loss of funds. Ride is suitable for building <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/dao\">DAOs</a>, Escrow facilities, Referral and Loyalty systems, Marketplaces, Digital Securities, P2P-lending, Gaming, Identity, and many other applications.\n\nThe available developer tools include Waves IDE for sandbox development, the Visual Studio code plugin for advanced users, an Oracle protocol, and tools to connect <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-applications-dapps\">dApps</a> to data sources. Waves also offers a native desktop and mobile Client for accessing certain platform features, including token creation and operations, sending and exchanging tokens, and leasing WAVES. Waves Keeper, a browser plug-in similar to Ethereum\u2019s <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/metamask\">MetaMask</a>, allows users to interact with Waves-enabled websites and dApps.\n\nThe platform provided a decentralized exchange, known as Waves DEX, for crypto-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat trading.

This model allows traders to move between different asset pools using RUNE as a somewhat hidden intermediary. It also rewards liquidity providers (LPs), those that deposit or \u201cstake\u201d assets on either side of a liquidity pool, with a portion of trading fees.\n\nIt uses an AMM model to facilitate cryptoasset swaps\nan independent cryptonetwork that aims to enable the exchange of assets across disparate blockchain networks in a non-custodial manner. Its protocol features a cross-chain bridge system (known as the  Bifr\u00f6st Protocol) to connect different chains. THORChain also uses an adapted version of Bancor's \"smart tokens,\" which it calls Continuous Liquidity Pools (CLPs), to facilitate the exchange of assets. The key difference is that CLPs reward users for contributing to the liquidity in each pool.

Non-custodial exchanges, otherwise known as decentralized exchanges (DEXs), were the long-term solution. Therefore, the THORChain team set out to build an independent blockchain that could bridge to external networks and thus facilitate cross-chain transfers, functioning similarly to a DEX.\n\nThe problem often facing DEXs is finding sufficient liquidity. Traders gravitate towards platforms where they won't lose any value due to slippage. But these same traders are the ones to provide enough liquidity to prevent slippage in the first place. In response, the THORChain team plans to implement an adapted model of Bancor's \"smart token\" to create what it calls Continuous Liquidity Pools (CLPs). These pools of available assets give traders access to liquidity without needing to find or contact another buyer or seller.\n\nTHORChain also distributes rewards in the form of RUNE (the network's native token) to any user that adds tokens to a liquidity pool. At the same time, token owners can stake their assets and earn the fees accumulated from other users accessing the pool.\n\nTHORChain is a Tendermint-based chain, and therefore uses Tendermint BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) as its consensus mechanism. It also employs Proof-of-Stake (PoS) for Sybil resistance. As part of the PoS element, a system of validators can stake RUNE tokens to run network nodes and validate transactions. THORChain allows token holders to delegate to these validators, which keeps validators in check and permits delegators to a portion of each block reward.\n\nThe project is looking to launch its mainnet at some point in 2021.

The project opted to distribute these assets through a few tokens sales, a reward mechanism for providing liquidity, and direct allocations to early contributors. THORChain also has an incentive model for node operators, whereby these participants can earn rewards from a pool of pre-minted tokens once the network launches.\n\nIn Oct. 2019, THORChain opted to burn all of the \"unused\" reserve RUNE, which when combined with the ~15 million tokens burned through Project Surtr, amounted to 50% of the initial max supply. The supply reduction did not impact the tokens already distributed to Pre-Sale and Initial DEX Offering (IDO) investors. The allocation of the original, pre-minted RUNE supply, as well as the post-burn amounts, are as follows:\nService nodes: 500 million (220,447,472 RUNE post-burn) to reward network validators and liquidity contributors\nOperational reserves (THORChain company): 130 million (65 million post-burn) to use for Staff incentives, other sales, and liquidity bootstrapping\nCommunity reserves (RUNEVault): 120 million (now 60 million)\nTeam & Advisors: 100 million (now 50 million)\nSeed investors: 60 million (now 30 million)\nPre-Sale (Private Sale) investors: 70 million\nInitial DEX Offering (IDO): 7 million (of the 20 million offered in the sale, 13 million went unsold and were later burned)\n\nToken sales\nTHORChain kicked off RUNE distribution through what it called an Initial DEX Offering (IDO).

THORChain sold 7 million RUNE (out of a proposed 20 million) during the IDO at an average price of  $0.032, raising $224,000 worth of BNB in the process.\n\nThe project also completed a Seed round and a pre-sale before launching its IDO. The Seed round distributed 60 million RUNE priced at $0.01, while the pre-sale sold 70 million tokens at a 30% max discount compared to the IDO price (which was about $0.023).\n\nCommunity reserves\nMost (if not all) of the Community Reserve will go through RUNEVault, a user interface that allows users to stake their RUNE on Binance Chain in exchange for pre-minted RUNE rewards.

The supply reduction did not impact the tokens already distributed to Pre-Sale and Initial DEX Offering (IDO) investors. The allocation of the original and post-burn amounts, along with their vesting schedules, are as follows:\nService nodes & liquidity incentives: 220,447,472 RUNE (initially 500 million) of ongoing emissions through validator rewards and liquidity pool provisioning incentives\nOperational reserves (THORChain company): 65 million (initially 130 million) that vest monthly over 40 months (3.5 years) since initial distribution. THORChain may also use tokens from this pool for OTC sales to strategic partners.\nCommunity reserves (RUNEVault): 60 million (initially 120 million) emitted over 2.5 years through the RUNEVault rewards program and airdrop events\nTeam & Advisors: 50 million (initially 100 million), which are locked until mainnet launch, then released in 20% batches every three months\nSeed investors: 30 million (initially 60 million), of which four million were distributed immediately. The rest of the tokens will remain locked until mainnet launch, then released in 20% batches every three months\nPre-Sale (Private Sale) investors: 70 million. 50% of this pool was unlocked upon distribution to provide enough liquidity on Binance DEX. The other half unlocked one week after the close of THORChain's initial DEX offering (IDO).\nInitial DEX Offering (IDO): 20 million, of which 13 million went unsold and were later burned, that came with no vesting schedule\n\nOngoing emissions\nTHORChain includes a few ongoing emission models to incentivize network participation:\nRUNEVault issues two million RUNE tokens each month as part of its staking rewards program. This issuance will continue until the Community reserves (60 million total tokens) runs out, which would allow the RUNEVault program to operate for about 2.5 years after its launch. Note that THORChain could revisit this model in the future with community input to reduce reserve emission.\nService nodes and liquidity provisioners will receive monthly distributions equal to the below block rewards calculation. Two-thirds of this block reward will go to service nodes (aka validators), and the remaining third will go towards liquidity incentives. Block rewards will continue until this bucket's max supply of 220,447,472 RUNE is reached.\nblockRewardsPerMonth = maxSupply - circulatingSupply) / (6 * 12)\n\nProject Surtr (The RUNE burn program)\nTHORChain introduced Project Sutr in Aug. 2019, which aims to burn any unused RUNE from the various token reserves.

Tendermint employs its own BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) consensus mechanism that relies on synchronicity. Therefore, like Cosmos, THORChain caps the number of validators (100 to start) in order to reach finality for each proposed block. It also supports a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism since Tendmint requires each Validator to have a weight on the network determined by the stake they hold.\n\nContinuous Liquidity Pools (CLPs)\nThe THORChain team plans to implement an adapted model of Bancor's \"smart token\" to create what it calls Continuous Liquidity Pools (CLPs). This system incentivizes participants to supply liquidity in exchange for fees and RUNE rewards. Traders can then access and exchange with these token pools directly, which gives CLPs an on-going supply of liquidity. The protocol also tracks the ratio of RUNE to the asset held in each CLP, which creates an inherent on-chain price feed for individual assets.\n\nBifr\u00f6st Protocol\nThe Bifr\u00f6st Protocol is THORChain's cross-chain bridging system. The protocol leverages THORChain's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validator set, the on-chain price feeds generated by CLPs, multi-signature (multi-sig) accounts to create and secure these bridges. Every bridge uses validating parties to verify transactions. But the multi-sig system randomly assigns validators to each transaction to limit centralization concerns. Each bridge is customizable, where the end-user determines the number of parties required to sign-off on a transaction (a three-of-four multi-sig arrangement is less secure but faster than a 20-of-21 schema). The Bifr\u00f6st Protocol also uses the on-chain price feeds created by CLPs to give each bridge a security profile (how likely is a bridge to fail) and to identify and punish bridge validators that act against the network's rules.\n\nYggdrasil Protocol\nThe Yggdrasil Protocol is a sharding mechanism designed to help scale THORChain. Unlike more traditional sharding applications, which split items into horizontal components, the Yggdrasil Protocol uses a vertical sharding technique on entire chains. The team says this technique allows THORChain to apply sharding to cross-chain ecosystems, as opposed to sharding an existing chain. As for shard consensus, THORChain does not engage the full Validator Set to monitor each shard. Only a subset of validators will finalize cross-shard transactions. But the others will be able to monitor the consensus reached on every shard.", "client_repositories": [{"name": "THORNode", "link": "https://gitlab.com/thorchain/thornode", "license_type": "MIT"}]}, "security": {"audits": [{"title": "CertiK Audit", "date": "2020-04-20T04:00:00Z", "type": "Security", "details": "Security research firm CertiK ran an audit of THORChain's codebase from Jan. 21 to Mar. 3, 2020.

It aims to include and empower the three main network participants: Validators, Standby Validators, and Delegators.\n\nThe voting and delegation model is similar to systems seen in Tezos or Cosmos. THORChain validators can accept delegations from any RUNE token holder, thus boosting their overall stake and voting power. But block rewards get evenly distributed among validators, incentivizing delegators to seek out validators with a lower stake weight. The design aims to minimize voting power centralization at the top of the Validator Set (i.e., the top 100 validators). Prospective validators that exist outside of the top 100 are known are Standby Validators.\n\n__Two-layer design__\nThe *\u00c6*sir protocol consists of two distinct layers. One allows for delegators to vote on proposals (or submit a proposal) inside of a Staking Pool. The other layer lets Validators \"signal\" the voting results from each Staking Pool to see if a network-wide change has either passed or failed.\n\nThe validator for each Staking Pool can vote on behalf of every active delegator should they choose not to participate. [This mechanism](https://medium.com/thorchain/governing-thorchain-b04f1f0f656f) \"serves as a hybrid between direct and representative democracy.\" But the goal is to achieve 100% voter turnout within each pool. THORChain also plans to implement [Quadratic Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting) within Staking Pools to inhibit plutocracies. As part of the network's consensus mechanism, delegators can re-delegate at any time. Staking Pool votes must achieve a simple majority (51% threshold) to pass and move on to the Validator signaling stage.\n\nAs for the signaling layer, Validators will be able to read all current proposals as well as nominate their own changes each block. Unlike the Staking Pools, proposals at the Validator level must receive a supermajority (two-thirds or 67%) for the change to take effect. Validators that don't participate in the signaling period will get part of their stake slashed and redistributed to other Validators.\n\nValidators can also implement a grace period prior to voting, depending on the severity of the proposed amendment. Similar to Tezos, THORChain validators can opt to run \"sweeping architectural changes\" on the project's testnet before implementing them to the mainnet.", "is_treasury_decentralized": null},

Muneeb\u2019s Ph.D. thesis was on Blockstack. The two led their new startup through the <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/y-combinator\">Y Combinator</a> accelerator in the summer of 2014. Upon completion, the two raised a seed round led by <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/union-square-ventures\">Union Square Ventures</a> (USV), with participation from <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/naval-ravikant\">Naval Ravikant</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/svangel\">SV Angel</a>, and others.\n\nAfter launching a blockchain-based decentralized identity (DID) system in 2014, the team released the initial design for the then-Blockstack platform in 2015. They began R&D on its peer-to-peer communication and data storage system. The R&D phase lasted through 2017 and concluded with Blockstack releasing an alpha version of its developer platform, which included a developer release of the Blockstack Browser and a decentralized storage system. By the end of 2017, the company also secured two additional funding rounds via a Series A, led by USV, with participation from <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/lux-capital\">Lux Capital</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/digital-currency-group\">Digital Currency Group</a>, and others, as well as a token offering through the Reg D framework. (See the Fundraising section below for more details)\n\nReenvisioning how users interact with applications\nWith its initial funding secured, Blockstack continued to realize its vision: building a full-stack solution for decentralized<a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-applications-dapps\"> </a>applications (<a href=\"https://messari.io/article/decentralized-applications-dapps\">dApps</a>). The platform's focus is to replace the reliance on centralized cloud service providers and applications that require the storage of user information on these services to operate.\n\nAt a high level, Stacks processes run on the user\u2019s client, and data is stored individually. While the platform integrates a native blockchain, most computing is done on the edges, i.e., client devices. This design allows Blockstack to run a scalable network that uses the blockchain only when necessary.\n\nUsers can control their data on Stacks thanks to a unique ID system, which is recorded on the blockchain. This ID gives users the ability to independently store data in a medium of their choice and removes the need to maintain passwords for authentication.\n\nMainnet launch and Reg A qualified token offering\nStacks released a testnet for its blockchain (dubbed the Stacks network) in Q2 '18 and officially launched the Stacks v1 mainnet in October of the same year. This launch also distributed tokens to early investors and unlocked token transactions.\n\nThe team also introduced a pilot of its App Mining program with 38 registered apps. App Mining is Stacks' mechanism for incentivizing projects and developers to build on the Stacks network as the top applications by monthly active users receive STX rewards. The number of participating Stacks Ecosystem apps ballooned to almost 300 in its first twelve months. Stacks has since paused the App Mining program due to the challenges involved in providing an objectively fair distribution and weeding out those projects that were gaming the system. The Stacks Foundation plans to reopen the program under a new design after the launch of Stacks v2.\n\nIn July 2019, Hiro PBC (then called <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/blockstack-token-llc\">Blockstack PBC</a>) held the first token offering to qualify for the Reg A exemption. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the startup spent almost a year working with the SEC to meet the qualifications. By meeting the exemption terms, Hiro's unprecedented token offering landed the company another $15.5 million in capital. Investors received their tokens via a network hard fork about a month after the sale closed.\n\nCurrent status\nHiro PBC is headquartered in New York City with a team that includes computer scientists from Princeton, Stanford, MIT, and other top universities. Hiro PBC is the public benefit corporation at the heart of the Blockstack ecosystem.\n\nAs of November 2019, Hiro PBC has raised over $75 million from equity investments and token offerings -- about $23.0 million from two token offerings in 2019, $47.5 million from a token offering in 2017, and $5.1 million in equity investments. Investors in the Stacks Ecosystem include USV, Lux Capital, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/zhenfund\">Zhen Fund</a>, HashKey, Recruit Holding, SNZ, Digital Currency Group, Y Combinator, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/foundation-capital\">Foundation Capital</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/winklevoss-capital-management-llc\">Winklevoss Capital</a>, and over 4,500 other entities and individuals.\n\nAs of Oct. 2019, almost 300 applications are built on the platform with contributions from more than 100 independent developer teams. The Stacks network is still in v1, with v2 expected to launch sometime in Q4 2020. The next iteration, Stacks v2, will introduce functionality for Stacks' native smart contract language called Clarity and a new consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Transfer (PoX). Under PoX, independent Stacks miners will secure the network by pledging Bitcoin as collateral in exchange for the chance to earn newly minted STX tokens. The pledged Bitcoin will go to STX stakers (which Stacks calls \"stackers\"), who also help secure the network.\n\nThe project underwent a full rebrand in Oct. 2020. First, the community rebranded the Blockstack network and application ecosystem to the Stacks Ecosystem. Then, Blockstack PBC changed its company name to Hiro PBC and shifted its focus from guiding the Stacks blockchain to building developer tools for the network.", "issuing_organizations": [{"slug": "blockstack-token-llc", "name": "Hiro PBC", "logo": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-29%20at%201.43.40%20PM.png", "description": "Hiro PBC (formerly Blockstack PBC) is the public benefit corporation that creates developer tools for the Stacks Ecosystem.

It allows for the storage of user IDs and smart contract processing in addition to maintaining the native Stacks token. The first version of the blockchain used by Stacks operated on top of the Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\">$BTC</a>) blockchain and recorded transactions directly to the chain using a proof-of-burn mechanism. For version two Blockstack will introduce a new chain that uses Tunable Proofs for consensus. \n\nTunable Proofs allow the chain to use numerous inputs and assign weights to these inputs. In order to bootstrap their blockchain (ensuring that there is enough hash power from the start), Stacks will rely on a heavier weighting to the previously used proof-of-burn model in combination with native <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\">Proof-of-Work (PoW)</a>. Once there is enough <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/hash-power\">hash power</a> supporting the Stacks blockchain the weighting can shift towards native PoW. \n\nAdding efficiency to the Stacks blockchain is the Atlas Peer Network, which acts as an extended storage layer for the chain. Peers on the network attempt to store full replicas of the data allowing for less load on the Stacks chain. While many blockchains attempt to store all data directly on-chain the Stacks chain stores only hashes and relies on Atlas to store the full data.\n\nClarity smart contracts\nStacks has introduced a new smart contract language called Clarity. Clarity focuses on security, and predictability and is, therefore, non-Turing complete for single transactions and is directly interpreted by the virtual machine. Systems that compile code before it is deployed run the risk of introducing bugs that were not included in the original code. The lack of Turing completeness also enables static analysis which provides granularity on the cost and behavior of smart contracts before they are deployed. \n\nGaia storage system\nAn additional feature that enables scalability and user security is Gaia. Gaia is Stacks' storage system that removes the need for applications to store user data and instead gives the user a choice in where to store their data in a private encrypted manner, be it on a cloud provider or a local server. The Stacks blockchain, along with Atlas, stores pointers that allow applications to access user data. Information is encrypted when stored and only accessible when a user provides approval via their cryptographic keys. \n\nStacks authentication\nThe process of permissioning applications and retrieving data is largely invisible to users who instead interact with Stacks' authentication system. When a user logs into an app using their Stacks ID the user's client manages the authentication process directly from their device removing the need for server-side verification like passwords or 0Auth. A Stacks ID is used to interact with any application on the platform.\n\nStacks libraries and SDK\nThese various components are tied together with Stacks' SDK for developers and the user-facing Stacks browser which functions as an authenticator, app browser, and ID manager.

Helium believes that today's wireless connectivity options are wholely inadequate for the next generation of machines. To solve this they developed the Helium Hotspot, a combination of a physical blockchain node and wireless gateway that network participants can deploy to receive compensation in HNT, the native token. In order to receive rewards, Hotspots must submit proof of wireless coverage in a cryptographically verified location and time. Once the network is deployed, any sensor using the Helium LongFi wireless protocol can connect to the network which is intended for battery-powered devices sending small amounts of data over miles of range.  \n\nHotspots are rewarded in HNT based on the quality of the coverage they provide and the amount of LongFi sensor data they transport for devices on the network. HNT is burned to create Data Credits, a non-fungible token used for all transaction fees on the network. Data Credits are required for things like sending sensor data and asserting Hotspot location. Any LongFi-enabled IoT device can send data through any Helium Hotspot that's providing coverage.\n", "issuing_organizations": []}, "roadmap": [{"title": "Helium Mainnet Launch", "date": "2019-07-29T04:00:00Z", "type": "Mainnet Launch", "details": "Helium blockchain Mainnet goes live"}, {"title": "Austin, TX Network Launch", "date": "2019-08-01T04:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": "The first city-wide Helium network is deployed in Austin, TX"}, {"title": "Open Sourcing of Helium network components", "date": "2019-10-20T04:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": "Helium released most components of the network as open-source software and hardware.

This score represents the Network's confidence in their location as derived from those challenges, and thus the quality of their Helium LongFi wireless coverage\n\nConsensus is reached using the Helium Consensus Protocol. It works by having the best proofs of coverage from the prior epoch elect members for the next one who then runs a distributed key generator to bootstrap their threshold encryption keys. Each member accepts transactions until they have a certain amount in their queue, then encrypts them with the threshold public key and gossips encrypted data around. Once members all share their proposed transactions, they are all threshold decrypted at which point they cannot be censored. The transactions are deduplicated, invalid ones removed, and they are combined into a new block. This block then has a threshold signature applied to it. Members trying to censor transactions will end up with a different block than honest nodes and thus their signature shares won\u2019t be valid.\n\nHelium provides coverage using LongFi, an open-source protocol in the Sub-GHz frequency band.

These loans are created by smart contracts that mint <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/dai\">Dai</a>, a stablecoin with a soft peg to the US dollar. The protocol was built by the Maker Foundation along with a number of outside parties and over time the foundation has worked to reduce its level of control. They have gradually ceded control to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) known as MakerDAO which governs the protocol. The DAO is comprised of individuals across the globe that own the MKR token which affords holders the right to vote on important changes.\n\nSingle Collateral Dai\nThe first iteration was known as Single Collateral Dai (SCD) because Ethereum was the only asset used as collateral to take out a loan. It launched in December 2017 and grew to support $100 million worth of debt. Despite a 94% decrease in the value of collateral over that time, the system remained healthy and Dai maintained a close peg to $1. Since Dai was the only widespread stablecoin that did not require a company to back it by holding US dollars, it became an integral piece of the growing decentralized finance ecosystem. While SCD proved to be effective, the intended goal was to transition to Multi Collateral Dai (MCD) that could accept collateral other than Dai as well as implement other key design changes.\n\nTransition to Multi Collateral Dai\nIn November 2019 MakerDAO <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/multi-collateral-dai-is-live\">upgraded</a> the protocol to MCD with Basic Attention Token (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bat\">BAT</a>) being voted as the first additional collateral available. The existing single collateral system continues to function as is while users are encouraged to migrate to the new Dai. Eventually, the single collateral system will be phased out altogether. In addition to the new collateral, MCD made other important design changes such as the introduction of the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) which allows Dai holders to earn yield and collateral auctions that create a competitive market for liquidations.\n\nInternal controversy\nTowards the end of 2018, the Maker Ecosystem Growth Fund (MEGF) was established to oversee the treasury of MKR tokens by nine board members chosen by the CEO Rune Christensen. According to a document from the former CTO Andy Milenius, titled \u201dZandy\u2019s Story\u201d, after some disagreements as to how the fund was to be allocated, Rune presented two divergent choices. The \u201cred pill\u201d was for those who would follow his lead and focus on government compliance and integration into the existing financial system while the blue pill for those who didn\u2019t want a formal organizational structure and would work on MCD and then cease to be funded. However, there was one group that wanted to explore alternative options that called themselves the Purple Pill. When this group was discovered it was seen as conspiratorial and five members of the board that were members of the Purple Pill group were subsequently fired. Those members then sent a legal letter stating they were wrongfully terminated.", "issuing_organizations": [{"slug": "dai-foundation", "name": "Maker Foundation", "logo": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1573689600%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3D40nJxrC4oLGXmtycZ_GxcpV-vcl7VijAqEtxnWpbXSE", "description": "The Maker Foundation built the Maker protocol and created the initial supply of tokens.

The dollar value of the collateral must be greater than 150% the value of Dai (current Collateralization Ratio). The user can transact freely with their Dai. If they want to receive their initial collateral they must pay back both the Dai they withdrew plus the interest rate on the loan (Stability Fee). If at any point, the value of the collateral drops below the collateralization ratio, then their position is subject to liquidations where anyone can come in and purchase the underlying collateral to repay the debt.

The collateral in the vault is then sold until the outstanding debt is repaid plus a liquidation penalty. At that point, the auction becomes a reverse auction, where a bidder bids on accepting smaller parts of collateral for that fixed amount of Dai. Once the process ends, the remaining collateral is returned to the vault owner.\nDebt Auctions occur in the worst-case scenario when the price of collateral drops precipitously such that it can no longer cover the entire debt paid. The system will first look towards the surplus from Stability Fees to cover the debt. If that is not sufficient, a reverse auction occurs to cover the fixed amount of Dai necessary to make the system whole. Bidders compete on willingness to accept decreasing amounts of MKR for the shortfall in Dai.\n\nDai Savings Rate (DSR)\nThe DSR was implemented in MCD as a way for Dai holders to earn interest on their holdings. Users can deposit Dai into a non-custodial smart contract and immediately begin earning interest funded by Stability Fee payments. They are also free to withdraw at any time. The DSR serves as a monetary policy tool for governance to control the outstanding supply of Dai in order to manage the $1 peg. If the peg were to drop below $1, MKR holders could vote to increase the DSR. This would incentivize Dai holders to lock more Dai up, decreasing the supply and ideally bringing the price back up.", "client_repositories": []}, "security": {"audits": [{"title": "Initial Audit", "date": "2016-08-25T04:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": "Audit [performed](https://github.com/makerdao/audit-2/blob/master/makerdao_audit_aug_2016_public.pdf) by Peter Vessenes "}, {"title": "Sai Security Assessment", "date": "2017-10-24T04:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": "Audit [performed](https://makerdao.com/CodeReview/Sai_Final_Report.pdf) by Trail of Bits\n"}, {"title": "Single-Collateral Dai", "date": "2017-12-15T05:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": "Audit [performed](https://makerdao.com/saiCodeReview/SAI%20Coin%20Code%20Review_v1_3.pdf) by Jordi Baylina, Barry Whitehat, Adri\u00e0 Massanet, Eduardo Antu\u00f1a, Arthur Lunn, Antoni Martin, Griff Green"}, {"title": "MCD smart contract audit report", "date": "2019-10-04T05:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": "PeckShield performed an [audit](https://github.com/makerdao/mcd-security/blob/master/Audit%20Reports/PeckShield_Final_Audit_Report.pdf) and discovered 16 issues of varying severities, none of which were thought to be critical.

"}]}}, "governance": {"governance_details": "The Maker protocol is ultimately governed by the MKR holders, where one token equals one vote. Anyone is free to submit a proposal which then goes through a Governance Poll to establish rough community consensus. Polls can be proactive to account for one-off or intermittent issues that need to be addressed for future issues, or they can be reactive to respond to a present state change. Once there is general agreement, the issue is put up for an Executive Vote where MKR holders vote to enact the change.\n\nExamples of changes that can be made include:\nNew collateral types with their own unique risk parameters such as Collateralization Ratio and debt ceiling\nSelection of oracle feeds to input the market price of various collateral assets\nModifications to the Stability Fee or Dai Savings Rate\nAllocations of funds from the Maker Buffer which include the totally system\u2019s revenues from Liquidation and Stability Fees\nTriggering Emergency Shutdown\n\nEmergency Shutdown\nA critical component of Maker governance is the Emergency Shutdown capability. It serves two functions: to shutdown the old system in the event of a major upgrade as we will see with single collateral Dai, or as a last resort mechanism in the event of any malicious governance activity, attack or security breach. Once 50,000 MKR are placed in the Emergency Shutdown Module, it is enacted immediately to shut down the system and return collateral to Dai holders and Vault owners. Vault owners can withdraw their collateral minus the Dai debt owed which is then available for Dai holders through the main collateral claim process. This is a manual process where Dai holders use Dai to claim collateral at a fixed rate corresponding to the calculated value based on the Dai Target Price. In receiving their proportional claim of the collateral portfolio they could be at risk of a haircut due to the risk in decline of collateral value.\n\nGovernance Security Module (GSM)\nAfter an Executive Vote gets passed, there is a 24-hour delay period before the change gets deployed to give stakeholders time to review the code and maintain the integrity of the system. If they believe the change is detrimental to the system, MKR holders can opt for an Emergency Shutdown so that all stakeholders receive their fair value currently locked in the system.\n\nMakerDAO hosts weekly governance calls on Thursdays 4pm UTC", "onchain_governance": {"onchain_governance_type": "Direct On-Chain Vote", "onchain_governance_details": "While Governance Polls are conducted over discrete time periods to gauge community consensus, Executive Votes are continuous and represent the state of the system at all times. At any point in time, a proposal can be introduced that represents a new state of the protocol, which means MKR holders must continuously monitor for these changes and vote accordingly. In order to vote, MKR holders need to keep their tokens in a voting construct where they are then free to shift to competing proposals. Therefore the expectation is that MKR holders will play an active role in governance, deciding how the system evolves over time.", "is_treasury_decentralized": false}, "grants": [{"funding_organizations": [{"slug": null, "name": "The Maker Foundation", "logo": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1573689600%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3D40nJxrC4oLGXmtycZ_GxcpV-vcl7VijAqEtxnWpbXSE", "description": null}], "grant_program_details": "The Maker Foundation sponsors both the [Meetup Grants](https://community-development.makerdao.com/meetups) and [Development Grants Program ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/grants)which are both funded through the Foundation's reserves.

The CELO sold in 2018 will vest linearly every month for two years starting from mainnet launch. As for the second sale in 2019, purchasers received the option to pay $1.00 per token with a one-year lockup or $0.75 per token, which would add three-years to the base on-year lockup. The discount also included the option for purchasers to forgo the return of reserve funds in the event the mainnet release did not occur.\n\nThe project's most recent auction did not have any known restrictions on CELO once the governance system unlocks asset transfers; therefore, we assume all assets are liquid once token transitions are live. The cLabs team, founder, advisor, and contributor CELO allocations will vest over a five-year timeframe.\n\nOngoing Treasury sales\nThe Sales category in the supply curve accounts for all pre-launch sales and ongoing treasury sales from the Celo Foundation. The Foundation will periodically sell portions of its CELO treasury to fund operations and grant programs (Celo Foundation Treasury Policy). These sales will ideally occur at fixed intervals with an approximate target of 3% (but no more than 5%) of the rolling previous seven-day average trading volume of CELO. The Foundation doesn't anticipate any repurchase of CELO on the open market.\n\ncUSD reserve\nUp to120 million CELO will be dedicated to the programmatic reserve that helps maintain the 1:1 peg of Celo Dollar to the US Dollar. This model assumes the reserve will receive half (60 million CELO) of this allocation in the first year. The exact schedule and amounts released will depend upon demand for cUSD (expansions) as well as changes in the prices of reserve assets over time. Also, the reserve will hold 50% of its capital in non-CELO assets. If demand does not increase, the remaining reserve CELO allocation will not be liquid.\n\nEpoch rewards\nThe network will also feature an ongoing issuance in the form of epoch rewards (batch of block rewards). Epoch rewards will distribute the remaining 400 million CELO of the one billion max supply. At the end of each epoch, 75% (300 million total) of newly issued assets will go to network validators, while the Community Fund (24.5%) and a carbon offsetting fund (0.5%) receive smaller portions. All of these distribution models or how these CELO get spent is subject to on-chain governance and sufficient stability protocol reserves.\n\nAs for Celo's inflation rate, the proposed target curve (subject to change) of epoch rewards declines linearly over 15 years to 50% of the total 400 million CELO dedicated to ongoing issuance. After this first 15 years, the inflation rate decays exponentially with a half life of h=ln(2)\u00d715=10.3h.

Celo removes the need to check every header before a received header can be trusted. The network also uses BLS signature aggregation and succinct zero-knowledge proofs, via zk-SNARKs, to help improve performance.\nProgrammable (Full EVM Compatibility): Celo includes a programmable smart contract platform that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is already widely adopted, familiar to developers, and has strong tool support.\nSelf Custody: Users have access to and full control of their funds and account keys, and don't need to depend on third parties to make payments.", "client_repositories": [{"name": "Celo Monorepo", "link": "https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo", "license_type": "Apache License 2.0"}]}, "security": {"audits": [{"title": "Contracts Security Audit", "date": "2020-04-29T04:00:00Z", "type": "Security", "details": "OpenZeppelin completed a security audit of the smart contracts featured on the Celo network.

All changes must be agreed upon by CELO holders. A quorum threshold model is used to determine the number of votes needed for a proposal to pass.\n\nChanges are managed via the Celo Governance smart contract. This contract acts as an \"owner\" for making modifications to other protocol smart contracts. Such smart contracts are termed governable. The Governance contract will at first be owned by a multi-signature wallet. In the future, when the community's experience of DAOs (Distributed Autonomous Organizations) has evolved and when the platform has proven to be stable and secure, it will be owned by CELO holders effectively acting as a DAO.\n\nThe change procedure happens in the following phases:\n1. Proposal\n2. Approval\n3. Referendum\n4. Execution  \n\n__Hotfix proposal__\nThe cadence and transparency of the standard on-chain governance protocol make it poorly suited for proposals that patch issues that may compromise the security of the network, especially when the patch would reveal an exploitable bug in one of the core contracts. Instead, these sorts of changes are better suited for the more responsive, and less transparent, hotfix protocol.\n\nAnyone can make a proposal in the hotfix protocol by submitting the hash of their proposal to the Governance smart contract. If that hash is approved by the approver and a quorum of validators, the proposer can execute the contents of that proposal immediately.\n\nNote that this means the validators may not always know the contents of the proposal that they are voting on. Revealing the contents of the proposal to all validators may compromise the integrity of the hotfix protocol, as only one validator would need to be malicious in order to exploit the vulnerability or share it publicly. Instead, to convince the validators that the hash represents a proposal that should be executed via the hotfix protocol, the proposer should consider contacting reputable, third party, security firms to publicly vouch for the contents of the proposal.\n\n__Learn more:__\n[Celo Governance docs](https://docs.celo.org/celo-codebase/protocol/governance)\n[Celo Governance Proposals

While centralized services can offer these facilities, they are trust-based systems that compromise on the decentralized nature of cryptoassets. This can be solved by creating trustless peer to peer protocols, however, they require more active participation from borrowers and lenders needing to be matched. Compound looks to solve these problems by creating a pooled loan model that allows users to deposit into a pool that borrowers can then withdraw from provided they post sufficient collateral. This means loans do not have any maturity and users do not need to wait for a counterparty since they are interacting with the aggregate of all users. Compound allows users to earn interest on their holdings, short assets they think are overvalued, or obtain assets they need to utilize without having to purchase them.\n\nGradual decentralization\nCompound initially began as a tokenless protocol. Upgrades and changes were made unilaterally by the Compound Labs team. The protocol was still non-custodial but there was a centralized entity that retained administrative privileges. In order to remove themselves from this position, the team introduced COMP, a token used to govern the protocol.

In pursuit of this goal Dash created a two-tier network with incentivized nodes and decentralized project governance (Masternodes), instantly settled payments (InstantSend), instantly immutable blockchain (ChainLocks), and optional privacy (PrivateSend).\n\nThe Dash Network is governed by masternodes, powerful servers backed by collateral held in Dash designed to provide advanced services securely and governance over Dash's proposal system. In exchange for part of the block reward, masternodes provide a second layer of services to the network. They facilitate advanced functions such as InstantSend, PrivateSend, and ChainLocks, which protects Dash against 51% mining attacks. \n\nDash governance system, or treasury, distributes 10% of the block rewards for development of the project in a competitive and decentralized way.

They believed competing virtual currencies were not as viable for use in ordinary purchases, such as buying a cup of coffee, because transactions can take too long to confirm. Dash provides holders with a feature called InstantSend, which allows holders to send Dash on the Network and receive confirmation of their transactions instantly. Another feature Dash provides is PrivateSend, which provides enhanced privacy by mixing Dash of several holders before transmitting the Dash, thereby creating uncertainty regarding the source of the Dash being transferred (though transactions are still recorded on the blockchain and remain traceable when this feature is used). Utilizing PrivateSend makes it difficult for third parties to monitor the total value of a holder\u2019s electronic wallet (described in detail below), thereby providing greater protection from increasingly frequent criminal attacks (both digital and physical) targeted at individuals and entities holding significant digital assets.  \n\n\u201cMasternodes\u201d are nodes that perform specialized functions on the Network, including processing InstantSend and PrivateSend transactions. Operators of masternodes receive compensation payable in Dash for performing such services (as described below). Any holder can operate a masternode or change an existing node into a masternode by downloading specific software, and demonstrating that such holder has a transaction output storing a sum of exactly 1,000 Dash. Masternode status is maintained for so long as the operator continues to hold that transaction output storing exactly 1,000 Dash and the masternode adequately services user requests. If the transaction output is used as an input in a transaction, the Network automatically strips the holder of its status as a masternode and its ability to carry out the specialized functions. In addition, masternodes are subject to proof-of-service; if masternodes fail to provide services to the network, they are banned from the masternode layer of the network and discontinue receiving compensation. Operators of masternodes maintain custody and control of the 1,000 Dash collateral at all times. The 1,000 Dash is not pooled or used for collective projects or investments, and they are not paid interest or dividends on their Dash. A holder can operate multiple masternodes provided that each masternode maintains the requisite 1,000 Dash. \n\nInstantSend details: https://blog.dash.org/deterministic-masternode-list-and-automatic-instantsend-now-live-f2028d833388 ;  PrivateSend details: https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/introduction/features.html#privatesendprivatesend;", "client_repositories": []}, "security": {"audits": [{"title": "PrivateSend audit", "date": "2016-11-11T05:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": "During this review, weaknesses, both from an architectural and implementation point of view, were discovered.

This ensures that all assets and intellectual property are under permanent control of the network itself, rather than any individual or company. Through on-chain governance (described below), the masternodes elect the trust protectors, who have the authority to direct the trustee to oversee Dash Core Group (e.g., assign the board of directors).  \n\nProposals generally begin life as simple pre-proposal forum posts on the Dash Forum, where feedback and suggestions are solicited from the general community. Once the proposal owner decides they have a reasonable chance of passing their proposal, it is created as a governance object on the blockchain. A fee of 5 DASH is associated with this action to prevent spam and ensure only serious proposals make it to this stage. Several tools exist to allow masternode operators to comfortably review and vote on proposals. The net total of yes votes must exceed 10% of the total masternode count at the time votes are tallied in order to pass. If there are more passing proposals than the available block reward can provide for, the proposals with the most yes votes will pass first, creating a cut-off point for less popular proposals. The same process is then repeated every month, and the total amount of Dash available for proposals decreases by approximately 7.14% per year, together with the overall block reward.  \n\nWebsites, such as DashCentral, Dash Nexus, and Dash Ninja are available to monitor progress over time and gather more detailed statistics. Dash Masternode Tool also allows for voting without the need to share masternode private keys with a third party service.  \n\nEach proposal includes a description of the proposal goals, details of what work will be done and a breakdown of the requested budget. Many proposals also link to their own website or the pre-proposal discussion, or include a video to validate the identity and sincerity of the proposal owner. Discussion on DashCentral and/or Dash Nexus occurs below this information, and masternode owners have the option to verify their ownership of a masternode and ability to cast a vote by signing a message from the masternode collateral address. Masternodes can vote at any time, and also change their vote at any time until the cutoff block is mined and voting stops. This occurs 1662 blocks prior to the superblock. After voting stops, the blockchain executes a decentralized tally and validates all votes. Once consensus is reached, the results are broadcast and the budget is allocated soon after in a superblock.  \n\nOnce passed, proposals are able to report back to the network on the Dash Forum or via published public channels and social media. Since it is possible to create proposals that pay out over several months, it is also possible to revoke funding from a project by changing the vote if development or spending of already allocated funds is unsatisfactory. This encourages proposal owners to work honestly and diligently to win the trust and approval of the network. Ongoing discussion and gradual improvement over time results in a close bond between the network and those working for the network in supporting roles.  \n\nVoting on proposals is updated in real time via P2P messages and stored by Dash in cache files, so current winning proposals and the total allocation of the available budget are always open and visible to everyone.   \n\nFinally, Dash Watch (which was itself funded through a budget proposal) exists to monitor the ability of blockchain contractors to deliver on their promises with respect to delivery dates and the total amounts of budget allocated over multiple voting periods. A team of dedicated staff routinely interact with proposal owners to track progress of the various projects and provide reports to voting masternodes in a single location. While providing data on the performance of a proposal to Dash Watch is optional, many masternode owners take advantage of the data they make available to make a voting decision.", "onchain_governance": {"onchain_governance_type": "Direct On-Chain Vote", "onchain_governance_details": "Decentralized Governance by Blockchain, or DGBB, is Dash\u2019s attempt to solve two important problems in cryptocurrency: governance and funding. Governance in a decentralized project is difficult, because by definition there are no central authorities to make decisions for the project. In Dash, such decisions are made by the network, that is, by the owners of masternodes. The DGBB system allows each masternode to cast a vote (yes/no/abstain) on each proposal. Proposals are most often regarding the allocation of the network's funding. If a proposal passes, the payment specified by the proposal is paid in a monthly \"superblock\" along with all the passing proposals that month. Decision proposals are occasionally submitted to the network for important or contentious decision. For example, the outcome of a vote can be used to determine whether a feature should be implemented (or not) by Dash\u2019s developers. A key example is early in 2016, when Dash\u2019s Core Team submitted a proposal to the network asking whether the blocksize should be increased to 2 MB. Within 24 hours, consensus had been reached to approve this change. Compare this to Bitcoin, where debate on the blocksize has been raging for nearly three years and has resulted in serious splits within the community and even forks to the Bitcoin blockchain.  \n\nThe DGBB also provides a means for Dash to fund its own development. While other projects have to depend on donations or premined endowments, Dash uses 10% of the block reward to fund its own development. Every time a block is mined, 45% of the reward goes to the miner, 45% goes to a masternode, and the remaining 10% is not created until the end of the month. During the month, anyone can submit a budget proposal to the network. If that proposal earns the net approval of at least 10% of the masternode network, then at the end of the month the requested amount will be paid out in the \u201csuperblock\u201d. At that time, the block rewards that were not paid out (10% of each block) will be used to fund approved proposals.

The DAO is governed by CRV (an ERC-20 token), Curve's native governance token which launched in August of 2020. The launch of the CRV token led to a surge of volume and helped Curve hit over $1 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) for the first time.\n\nCurve aims to help liquidity providers maximize return while also minimizing trader fees, reducing price slippage, mitigate risk, and provide ample liquidity.

The $CRV token controls the protocol and gives holders the ability to submit proposals and potential changes to the allocations of pools. Voters can examine each pool and decide on different allocations that may generate higher or more secure returns (APY).

Curve's AMM equation is complex but the results are simple \u2013 low slippage on small to medium trades and decent liquidity on larger ones.\n\nCurves model, which provides a 'middle-ground' between constant price and Uniswap's AMM model (x*y = constant product),  achieves significantly lower slippage in prices on the demand side of the exchange.\nTo learn more about Curve's AMM Model see <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/the-evolution-of-the-constant-function-market-maker\">The Evolution of the Constant Function Market Maker</a>\n\nLiquidity Providers:\nCurve operates via liquidity pools where two (or more) assets are deposited into a pool and traded against each other. Arbitrage keeps the prices of the assets even with prices on other exchanges and half of the 0.04% fee (taken from trades) is paid to LPs. The other half of the 0.04% fee is paid to veCRV holders. At higher volumes of trade the APY on deposited assets increases \u2013 more trades means more fees are being paid. Curve's 0.04% fee is much lower than other exchanges, which could explain the high levels of trading volume it has hosted.\n\nAll LPs receive CRV tokens in addition to the interest from fees. When depositing LPs should put assets in pools in an equal ratio (50/50). If they don't the AMM equation will devalue one of the coins letting arbitrageurs bid some of the value out of their deposit.\n\nOn top of the fee paid to LPs, Curve incentivizes deposits via rewards from other DeFi projects. Currently, protocols REN and Synthetix incentive LPs to deposit in pools containing their assets by giving LPs their respective tokens ($REN and $SNX).\n\nyEarn:\nSome of Curve's pools, called yPools, are pools that have integrated with lending and borrowing protocols like Compound and Yearn Finance. yEarn is the algorithm that provides liquidity to these protocols and works to get the best rate of return on the lent assets. yPools lend funds to the protocols and in return, these pools give LPs rewards in cTokens and Ytokens. Much like a bank lends its customers' savings in order to return them higher interest rates, Curve's goal with this practice is to maximize rewards for those willing to provide stablecoin liquidity on their platform.\n\nImpermanent Loss:\nImpermanent loss is the loss that occurs to LPs when the price of one of the two assets that exist in a pool, say DAI/ETH, is more volatile than the other. If the price of one of the assets swings in relation to the other asset but does not change within the liquidity pool itself arbitragers can buy the asset from the pool and sell it on another exchange. LPs lose the gains made on their assets because the profit made from the bidding up of ETH was essentially drained by arbitragers. \n\nHowever, so long as the LPs do not withdraw their funds, the loss remains impermanent; the price of the asset could go back to its previous level, meaning the LPs would not have actually made any more money if they had just held the assets themselves. LPs are incentivized to deposit funds so long as the fees and yield paid to them exceeds the impermanent loss. \n\nSeveral DEXs, including Curve, are working on solutions to Impermanent Loss. Curve recently partnered with Peanut, a \"DeFi price balancer\", to explore the possibility of preventing impermanent loss. Curve LPs typically have a much lower risk of impermanent loss \u2013 the only assets traded on Curve are stable so typically any impermanent loss would be negligible. \n\nCopy-cat:\nAn EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible version of Curve is being built on Polkadot. The team behind Polkadot's Curve is not affiliated with Curve itself.\n\nIntegrations:\nCurve Finance has integrated with 1inch, Paraswap, Totle swap Dex.ag, Debank, InstaDapp DSA, CoinGecko, Zapper.fi, Zerion, Pools.fyi, Spells.fyi, dydx, Etherscan, and CoinMarketCap.\n\n", "client_repositories": []}, "security": {"audits": [{"title": "First Audit by Trail of Bits", "date":

Amp tokens used as collateral are generally released when consensus for a particular transfer is achieved, making them available to collateralize another transfer. In the event that consensus is not achieved for the transfer, the Amp collateral can instead be liquidated to cover losses. Amp facilitates instant, verifiable assurances for any pending or future value transfer, so that any actions dependent on the transfer can proceed without delay. By using Amp as collateral, individuals and entities benefit from the security and efficiency of collateral which is transparently attestable on an immutable ledger.\n\nFlexa, a payments network, is the first use case of Amp's features as a collateral token.

Collateral partitions represent subsets of Amp tokens that provide collateral for particular purposes, and are distinguished on the Ethereum blockchain with unique partition addresses. Each collateral partition can be endowed with its own set of rules regarding transfer hooks and privileges, and can also implement a predefined partition strategy in order to enable special capabilities (e.g., collateral models in which tokens are staked without ever leaving their original address).\n\nTo lock, release, and reward collateral, Amp uses on-chain collateral managers, which are smart contracts that manage Amp on behalf of a specific collateralization application. Collateral managers interact closely with collateral partitions to allow, deny, and redirect Amp token transfers as needed and support the collateralization of value transfer activities. Amp has been designed to support any number of collateral manager contract implementations, and anyone can build and deploy their own collateral manager smart contract to integrate Amp with their own applications and use cases.\n\nThe first collateral manager built on Amp is the Flexa collateral manager, which manages the Amp tokens staked to the Flexa network for the purpose of securing digital asset payments. To incentivize staking Amp, the Flexa collateral manager uses each collateral partition as a \"pool,\" to which anyone can contribute Amp tokens, and in which the Flexa collateral manager deposits a network reward as a percentage of each successful transfer's value. Due to Amp\u2019s role within the Flexa network, it not only accrues the value of the entire network\u2019s spending capacity, but also provides for a system of network rewards that are both highly elastic and exponential.", "client_repositories": [{"name": "Primary GitHub Repo", "link": "https://github.com/amptoken/amp-token-contracts\t\t\t", "license_type": "MIT License"}]}, "security":

How the protocol processes transactions is centralized, but its Plasma-based design aims to decentralize network security. It also relies on Ethereum at its final arbitration layer. Most blockchain ecosystems are limited by low throughput, high and unpredictable transaction fees, and poor user experience. The project's team believes these are barriers that need to be overcome before businesses and developers will adopt blockchain for real-world applications, leading them to develop the OMG Network.\n\nThe core security proposition of Plasma revolves around honest users being able to exit the child chain (in other words, withdraw funds to the root chain) at any time. To exit the child chain, a user submits an exit transaction \u2013 along with an exit bond \u2013 to the root chain. The exit is subject to a \"challenge period,\" during which any user can prove, if applicable, that the exit is invalid. If successfully shown to be invalid, the exit is not processed, and the challenger is awarded the exit bond. This exit game is solely dependent on the root chain.\n\nAs the child chain relies on the root chain to be its ultimate arbiter, it must periodically commit a hashed version of its state changes to the root chain by way of a smart contract. As opposed to submitting individual transaction data onto the root chain, the child chain bundles transactions into a Merkle tree and submits the root hash. Beyond these core elements, there is no prescribed configuration for a Plasma chain. They can take on different consensus protocols, block validation mechanisms, or fraud proofs. The design is adaptable to the use case. OMG Network is based on the Plasma MoreVP design, an extension of Minimum Viable Plasma optimized for the settlement of payments and value exchange between users and exchanges.\n\nThe original OMG Network team (under the OmiseGo name) co-authored the original Plasma white paper with Joseph Poon and was also the first project to perform an airdrop, a way to more widely share ownership of our token with the existing Ethereum community.", "issuing_organizations": [{"slug": "omisego", "name": "OMG Network", "logo": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/Ft-lxp5T_400x400.jpg", "description": "Omise, a Thailand-based payment service provider, formed the Omise Blockchain Lab in 2015 to explore how blockchain could help provide real-world payment solutions.

Since the launch of its ERC-20 token, Enjin Coin (ENJ), the firm has since built out its own set of blockchain tools and services. In January of 2018, the gaming firm released the own android version of its blockchain wallet, the Enjin Wallet. A few months later the firm released an iOS version of its Enjin wallet.\n\nDuring the summer of 2018, Enjin officially launched its Enjin Platform on the Ethereum mainnet is also compatible with the Kovan Testnet. The Enjin Platform is a platform as a service that allows other game developers to issue fungible and non-fungible assets as in-game Ethereum tokens. That same year, Enjin proposed a new ERC token standard \u2013 ERC-1155 \u2013 which was approved in 2019 and now implemented in its current software.\n\nFollowing the inception of the ERC-1155 token standard, Enjin created a marketplace for individuals to buy and sell ERC-1155 assets.

Enjin utilizes a GraphQL-based API that enables game developers to facilitate the smart contract interactions and other services related to interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAdditionally, Enjin utilizes a backend service called \u201cTrusted Cloud\u201d that acts as the cloud-hosting service that connects games to Ethereum. Enjin\u2019s Trusted Cloud acts as a proxy that gathers requests from clients and game servers and returns the data back to each game. Enjin\u2019s cloud service also links user\u2019s existing game accounts (i.e. SteamID, X-box live) to a block wallet address.\n\nEnjin\u2019s crypto wallet connects directly to the Enjin Platform and stores all the digital items for games built on Enjin\u2019s Platform. The Enjin wallet must be used for all games on the Enjin platform because it directly links an Ethereum address to an Enjin Platform user identity. The gaming company is also developing \"Wallet Daemon\", a tool that automates transaction requests to and from the Enjin Platform. Additionally, the Enjin wallet enables a QR service for purchasing or receiving ERC-1155 denominated assets.\n\nCreating any blockchain asset on the Enjin Platform requires spending Enjin Coin. Game developers have the potential to customize the amount of Enjin Coin an in-game item is worth as well as the desired fungibility of each item. Assets and items created for games on the Enjin Platform can always be exchanged back into Enjin coins by users or game developers.\n\nEnjin is also developing an Ethereum scaling solution called Efinity that will be utilized within the Enjin Platform. The company claims games will be able to open channels within the Efinity network that will enhance the speed of relaying information between smart contracts and game servers.

Instead, peers simply \"gossip\" with each other about shared data, and if rules are broken, a given transaction is rejected by a validating peer. \n\nCritical to Holochain's architecture is an understanding of agent-centric design. Cryptocurrencies are, according to the team, data-centric, which is to say they are built around the concept that data is a specific object. But Holochain aims to be agent-centric which supports the idea that a network and its protocol are not an actual objective thing. Instead, Holochain says it's a variety of shared, relative experiences. \n\nHolo, on top of Holochain, aims to allow network participants to transform their computers into small sources of revenue by hosting compatible decentralized applications. Hosts set their own prices and select which dapps they want to host. Holo is an ERC-20 compliant token used to fuel peer-to-peer relationships on Holo.

Due to the Zerocoin protocol's novelty and computational intensity, however, Bitcoin core developers deemed it impractical for implementation into the Bitcoin protocol. Subsequently, with additional improvements to the protocol that resulted in substantially more efficient zero knowledge proofs, Zerocoin's founding scientists from John Hopkins in collaboration with researchers from MIT and Tel Aviv University created a new protocol called \"Zerocash\" (Zcash). Upon recruiting it's CEO, Zooko Wilcox, to head the project and raising over $3mm in venture funding through two fundraises, the Zcash protocol began development under the Zcash Company, with the objective of building the Zcash protocol into a full-fledged cryptocurrency. In 2017, a separate entity, the Zcash Foundation was incorporated as a 501(c)3 nonprofit with the mission to build internet payment and privacy infrastructure for the public good, primarily serving the users of the Zcash protocol and blockchain  In 2019, the Zcash Company rebranded to the Electric Coin Company.\n\nZcash was conceived from the observation that Bitcoin could not offer strong privacy guarantees, with transactions recorded in a public decentralized ledger, from which significant information can be deduced. At the core of Zcash technology are zero-knowledge proofs, which allow transaction data to be validated without revealing information about the amount and the parties involved. With Zcash users can selectively share address and transaction information for auditing or regulatory compliance through the use of view keys and payment disclosure. Through the use of zero-knowledge proofs, Zcash aims to create a truly fungible, privacy preserving cryptocurrency.\n\nZcash is built on strong science and audited by third parties. It is an open-source protocol, built by a security-specialized engineering team, and originally based on Bitcoin Core's codebase.", "issuing_organizations": [{"slug": "electric-coin-company", "name": "Electric Coin Company", "logo": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/ECC-icon-fullcolor.png", "description": "The Electric Coin Company is a for-profit entity that launched and supports the development of Zcash"}, {"slug": "zcash-foundation", "name": "Zcash Foundation", "logo": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/a3Aw6vOK_400x400.jpg", "description": "A non-profit organization dedicated to financial privacy through technology"}]}, "roadmap": [{"title": "Overwinter", "date": "2018-06-01T04:00:00Z", "type": "Mainnet", "details": "Versioning, replay protection for network upgrades, performance improvements for transparent transactions, and a new feature of transaction expiry"}, {"title": "Sapling", "date": "2018-10-01T04:00:00Z", "type": "Mainnet", "details": "Drastically reduces the amount of time and memory needed for constructing zk-SNARKs"}, {"title": "Blossom", "date": "2019-12-11T05:00:00Z", "type": "Mainnet", "details": "The Blossom upgrade will cut block times in half to around 75 seconds.

A network of mining and economic nodes maintains this blockchain by validating, propagating, and competing to include pending transactions (mempool) in new blocks. Economic nodes (aka \"full nodes\") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and double-spend vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.\n\nMining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a hash less than the target number set by Zcash's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Zcash uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated \u201cwork\u201d (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain. Other network peers can cheaply verify the chain\u2019s work\n\nIn order to have zero-knowledge privacy in Zcash, the function determining the validity of a transaction according to the network\u2019s consensus rules must return the answer of whether the transaction is valid or not, without revealing any of the information it performed the calculations on. This is done by encoding some of the network\u2019s consensus rules in zk-SNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge). Zk-SNARKs are specific zero-knowledge proofs whereby one can prove possession of certain information, e.g. a secret key, without revealing that information, and without any interaction between the prover and verifier. \n\nZcash addresses are either private (z-addresses) or transparent (t-addresses). Z-addresses start with a \u201cz,\u201d and t-addresses start with a \"t.\" The two Zcash address types are interoperable, and funds can be transferred between z-addresses and t-addresses. A Z-to-Z transaction appears on the public blockchain, so it is known to have occurred and that the fees were paid. But the addresses, transaction amount and the memo field are all encrypted and not publicly visible. Transactions between two transparent addresses (t-addresses) work just like Bitcoin: The sender, receiver and transaction value are publicly visible. The owner of an address may choose to disclose z-address and transaction details with trusted third parties using view keys and payment disclosure. \n", "client_repositories": []}, "security": {"audits": [{"title": "Security Audit", "date": "2016-09-02T04:00:00Z", "type": "Mainnet", "details": "[https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/zcash-cryptography-and-code-review/?research=Public+Reports](https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/zcash-cryptography-and-code-review/?research=Public+Reports)"}, {"title": "Security Audit", "date": "2016-10-31T04:00:00Z", "type": "Mainnet", "details": "[https://coinspect.com/doc/CoinspectReportZcash2016.pdf](https://coinspect.com/doc/CoinspectReportZcash2016.pdf)"}, {"title": "Proof-of-work Analysis", "date": "2016-11-18T05:00:00Z", "type": "Mining Algorithm", "details": "[https://www.openwall.com/articles/Zcash-Equihash-Analysis](https://www.openwall.com/articles/Zcash-Equihash-Analysis)"}, {"title": "MPC Ceremony (Sprout) Audit", "date": "2017-09-21T04:00:00Z", "type": "MPC Ceremony", "details": "[https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/zcash-ceremony-and-audit/?research=Public+Reports](https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/zcash-ceremony-and-audit/?research=Public+Reports)"}, {"title": "Sapling Parameter Generation Security Proof", "date": "2018-05-18T04:00:00Z", "type": "MPC Ceremony", "details": "[https://github.com/zcash/sapling-security-analysis/blob/master/MaryMallerUpdated.pdf](https://github.com/zcash/sapling-security-analysis/blob/master/MaryMallerUpdated.pdf)"}, {"title": "Implementation Analysis (1.0.15) and Overwinter Specification Review", "date": "2018-05-29T04:00:00Z", "type": "Mainnet", "details": "[https://leastauthority.com/static/publications/LeastAuthority-Zcash-Implementation-Analysis-and-Overwinter-Specification.pdf](https://leastauthority.com/static/publications/LeastAuthority-Zcash-Implementation-Analysis-and-Overwinter-Specification.pdf)"}, {"title": "Zcash Overwinter+Sapling Specification", "date": "2018-08-17T04:00:00Z", "type": "Mainnet", "details": "[https://leastauthority.com/static/publications/LeastAuthority-Zcash-Overwinter+Sapling-Specification-Final-Audit-Report.pdf](https://leastauthority.com/static/publications/LeastAuthority-Zcash-Overwinter+Sapling-Specification-Final-Audit-Report.pdf)"}, {"title": "Zcash Source Code Review", "date": "2018-12-31T05:00:00Z", "type": "Mainnet", "details": "[https://coinspect.com/doc/CoinspectReportZcash2018.pdf](https://coinspect.com/doc/CoinspectReportZcash2018.pdf)"}, {"title": "Zcash Sapling Implementation / RPC Interface", "date": "2019-01-30T05:00:00Z", "type": "Mainnet", "details": "[https://leastauthority.com/static/publications/LeastAuthority-Zcash-Sapling-Implementation-RPC-Interface-Updated-Audit-Report.pdf](https://leastauthority.com/static/publications/LeastAuthority-Zcash-Sapling-Implementation-RPC-Interface-Updated-Audit-Report.pdf)"}, {"title": "Zcash Sapling Security Audit", "date": "2019-01-30T05:00:00Z", "type": "Mainnet", "details": "[https://cybermashup.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/zcash-audit.pdf](https://cybermashup.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/zcash-audit.pdf)"}, {"title": "Sapling audit", "date": "2019-01-31T05:00:00Z", "type": "Mainnet", "details": "[https://medium.com/qed-it/sapling-audit-9b531be9d30](https://medium.com/qed-it/sapling-audit-9b531be9d30)"}, {"title": "Zcash Overwinter Consensus and Sapling Cryptography Review", "date": "2019-01-31T05:00:00Z", "type": "Mainnet", "details": "[https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/zcash-overwinter-consensus-and-sapling-cryptography-review/?research=Public+Reports](https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/zcash-overwinter-consensus-and-sapling-cryptography-review/?research=Public+Reports)"}, {"title": "2018 Security Audit Results in Detail", "date": "2019-01-31T05:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": "[https://z.cash/blog/2018-security-audit-results-in-detail/](https://z.cash/blog/2018-security-audit-results-in-detail/)"}, {"title": "Known Attack Vectors", "date": null, "type": null, "details": "[https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/security_warnings.html](https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/security_warnings.html)"}], "known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities": []}}, "governance": {"governance_details": "Zcash is an open source community; historically most protocol development is largely handled by The Electric Coin Company.

Guardians are a superset of the validator committee. Valid blocks require two-thirds of Theta guardians to validate. Theta Tokens were initially distributed as ERC-20 compliant tokens on Ethereum but later were exchanged one-to-one for native Theta Network tokens.

Its brand tagline is \"Esports Entertainment Platform\". Content creators can earn Tfuel from viewer donations, a Tfuel pool paying out according to hours watched, viewer subscriptions. Content creators can also solicit donations from their viewers using credit cards, paid out in USD stablecoin to the creator's wallet.

All of Arweave\u2019s assumptions can be found in its yellowpaper.\n\nThe Arweave mainnet launched in June of 2018 with a select group of 1800 hand-picked participants across various countries. Before the launch, the Arweave team also conducted an initial token sale limited to whitelisted individuals.\n\nIn November of 2019, Arweave secured a $5 million funding round from several venture capital firms in exchange for $5 in Arweave tokens.

As the name suggests, the blockweave protocol utilizes a block-based structure where each block is linked to two blocks:\nThe most previous block in the Arweave blockweave\nThe recall block, a randomly selected block within the protocol\u2019s history. The recall block is determined by taking the hash of the current block and calculating its modulus with respect to the current block height.\nMiners must provide hashes from both of the prior blocks in order to create a new block and earn the block reward in the form of Arweave's native token (AR).\n\nNode Architecture\nThe protocol introduces variances to Bitcoin\u2019s node structure in which each node stores a block hash list \u2013 a list of the hashes of all previous blocks \u2013 designed to allow old blocks to be verified. Additionally, nodes possess a wallet list which contains a list of all \u201cactive wallets\u201d in the protocol.\n\nWildfire\nArweave also utilizes a data-sharing system called \u201cwildfire\u201d whereby Arweave nodes are ranked based on the speed at which each node responds to requests and accepts data from other nodes in the network. Nodes that fail to quickly share information can be blacklisted from the Arweave network permanently. The design is aimed at incentivizing good behavior amongst nodes in the network. \n\nBlockshadows\nFurther, Arweave implements another data management system called \u201cblockshadows\u201d \u2013 a process in which transactions are partially decoupled from blocks in favor of only sending other nodes a minimal block (the shadow) that enables other nodes in the network to re-create the full block. Blockshadows contain a hash of the wallet list, hash list, and a list of transaction hashes from the current block.\n\nPermaweb\nAnother notable aspect of Arweave\u2019s network is the \u201cpermaweb\u201d which sits atop of Arweave\u2019s data storage layer.

For those holding more than 100,000 HT, an additional 35% is deducted from the fee rate.\n\nHuobi Prime tickets\nHuobi Prime is the company\u2019s IEO platform than enables direct token offerings. They were designed to allow retail investors to invest in primary sales while limiting the purchase of tokens to an equivalent of $1,000 for early investors. Once the token sale is completed, they will be immediately tradeable against HT on the exchange. Huobi Prime listings occur in three rounds with larger discounts typically given in the earlier rounds. Participation typically requires a minimum average monthly HT and the trading quota is based on a tiered system of HT holdings. Once ticket sales are complete, the HT received are subsequently burnt.\n\nFastTrack voting\nEvery month, five projects are announced and then voted on by the community for listing on Huobi\u2019s exchange. The project with the highest number of votes will be listed, while the others go towards the next week\u2019s voting. Users that voted for the winning project are eligible to purchase tokens at a discounted value.

Shortly thereafter, following a promise to share a technical specification of the idea, tacotime started a new thread, publishing a whitepaper titled \"Memcoin2 (MC2): A Hybrid Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake Crypto-currency\". The proposal extended and combined the principles of both Litecoin and Peercoin, and was developed using btcd, the platform created by Decreds current developers.\n\nThroughout 2013 tacotime attempted to coordinate development of the project with another pseudonymous individual named ingsoc, eventually looking for a lead developer to get the project off the ground towards the end of the year. At the start of 2014 tacotime began work on another cryptocurrency, now known as <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/monero/profile\">Monero</a>, becoming a part of the founding core team for the project. Nevertheless tacotime was still working on MC2 in the background. \n\nIn early 2014, ingsoc approached <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/company-0\">Company Zero</a> (CO) and CEO <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/jake-yocom-piatt\">Jake Yocom-Piatt</a> with tacotime\u2019s MC2 concept, merging efforts to develop the Decred system. At the time, CO, formerly known as Conformal Systems, was an open-source software engineering firm that focused on privacy and security oriented solutions including btcd (eventually migrated to btcsuite), an alternative full node Bitcoin implementation written in Go. In late 2015. C0 published a series of blog posts outlining challenges they saw in Bitcoin and proposals for iterating upon it. \n\nUltimately, on December 12, 2015, Decred was announced as a solution to Bitcoin's perceived problems, which included inefficient governance and capture by core developers, lack of development funding, and excessive miner power over the Bitcoin network. The proposal was for \"an open, progressive, and self-funding cryptocurrency with a system of community-based governance integrated into its blockchain.\" At the core of the project was a hybridized proof-of-work proof-of-stake (PoW/PoS) consensus system that aimed to strike a balance between PoW miners and PoS voters to create a more robust notion of consensus. \n\nOn February 8, 2016 the Decred mainnet launched along with the Decred constitution, a set of principles and guidelines that provide users a clear understanding of the social contract between themselves and the project. At launch, 8% of the total supply was pre-mined, with 4% used to compensate the developers and 4% air-dropped to 2,972 people who signed up. \n\nIn June 2017 Decred became the first blockchain to make a successful direct on-chain user-activated consensus vote. In October 2018 Decred's Politeia proposal system launched, allowing Decred users and stakeholders to propose, discuss, collaborate on, and fund new projects, initiatives, and consensus changes on an off-chain platform. Since then Politeia has been used for a wide range of governance decisions including research, bug bounties, and even public relations. Current initiatives launched on Politeia include privacy upgrades, support for Lightning Network, an expanded communications plan, and a decentralized exchange.", "issuing_organizations": [{"slug": "company-0", "name": "Company 0", "logo": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/Company%200%20Logo.PNG", "description": "A Chicago-based developement group for Decred.

The price of tickets adjusts in order to keep the Ticket Pool, total number of tickets on the Decred network, near the target pool size of 40,960 tickets. This is done to aid predictability in staking activity, so stakers need not worry about drastically fluctuating parameters that determine how frequently you get to participate in consensus.\n\nEach block 5 tickets are randomly selected by a Poisson distribution to validate blocks produced by POW miners, and vote on Decred governance proposals during voting periods. The average time it takes for a ticket to vote is 28 days, but possibly requiring up to 142 days, with a 0.5% chance of expiring before being chosen to vote (this expiration returns the original Ticket Price without a reward).\n\nMining\nMiners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks using the BLAKE-256 proof-of-work algorithm. In this process, miners compete to generate a <a href=\"https://messari.io/blog/hash-function\">hash</a> less than the target number set by Decred's <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level\">difficulty adjustment algorithm</a>. The target difficulty level is adjusted every 144 blocks (~12 hours).\n\nAlthough open to anyone with a CPU, Decred mining is now dominated by <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics\">ASICs</a>. In order to smooth individual miner revenue as mining has become more competitive, mining is now done in pools where participants contribute <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/hash-power\">hash power</a> to the pool and receive a proportional share of the profits if the pool finds a valid block.\n\nThe Decred block reward reduces by a factor of 100/101 every 6,144 blocks (approximately 21.33 days). Furthermore, the Decred block reward is allocated 60% to miners, 30% to stakers, and 10% to the Decred decentralized treasury.

Decred, the protocol, is a distributed, time-stamped ledger of <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/utxo\">unspent transaction output</a> (UTXO) transfers stored in an append-only chain of dynamic-sized data blocks. A network of mining and economic nodes maintains this blockchain by validating, propagating, and competing to include pending transactions (<a href=\"https://messari.io/article/mempool\">mempool</a>) in new blocks. Economic nodes (aka \"full nodes\") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and double-spend vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.\n\nMining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a hash less than the target number set by Decred's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Decred uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated \u201cwork\u201d (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain. Decred also uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to validate blocks submitted by miners (and vote on Decred governance proposals). The PoS layer serves to provide a check on miner power.\n\nDecred is actively pursuing integration with the Lightning network. So users can initiate payments across Bitcoin\u2019s network with its native token DCR and potentially hold multiple assets in Decredition, the Decred wallet solution. Additional steps required to release the decentralized exchange they are focused on building.\n\nCurrently, the project is adding support for Decentralized Autonomous Entities, DAEs, of which the Politeia is the first example. So users can band together with like-minded individuals to create organizations to support their missions.\n", "client_repositories": [{"name": "Decred", "link": "https://github.com/decred", "license_type": "ISC License"}]}, "security": {"audits": [], "known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities": []}}, "governance": {"governance_details": "Decred was deliberately designed prevent powerful individuals or central planning committees from gaining a disproportionate influence over the future of the project. Decred governance has its foundations in the Decred constitution - a set of principles and guidelines that provide users a clear understanding of the social contract between themselves and the project. \n\nThe Decred governance system is designed to allow the Decred community to decide upon anything ranging from protocol changes to decentralized treasury allocations. Governance in Decred works through a combination of on-chain and off-chain mechanisms. All Decred governance decisions are legitimized via its on-chain governance system; however, off-chain, is where the governance process begins.\n\nPoliteia\nEvery Decred governance proposal begin on Politeia (Pi). Politeia is a web platform that supports facilitates the submission, tracking, and discussion of Decred governance proposals by the stakeholder community. Anyone is free to submit new proposals for consideration. Once submitted proposals are reviewed by Politeia admins where they can censor spam proposals. However, to ensure transparency over what's being censored, All data on Politeia is periodically anchored into the Decred blockchain, using dcrtime, and users can prove censorship cryptographically if censorship occurs. Valid proposals appear publicly on Politeia, where discussion and revision take place. Once a proposal owner is confident in their proposal they can authorize voting on it. Owners authorize voting on their proposals by paying a 0.1 DCR fee. Once voting is authorized the on-chain governance process begins.\n\nConsensus Rule Voting\nFor governance proposals related to consensus rule changes, the process begins, like every proposal, with the Politeia system. Initial proposals for consensus changes are brought to life through the Politeia system in order to determine if the work necessary to create a working implementation, its associated Decred Change Proposal (DCP), and an on-chain vote for the rule change should be performed. Once a proposal has successfully gone through the Politea system, it then begins life as a DCP. DCPs are similar to <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/bitcoin-improvement-proposal-bip\">BIPs</a> in Bitcoin. DCPs are design documents describing protocol or consensus changes to Decred. After a DCP is written new software which implements the proposed change developed and released. Once released the on-chain governance process begins. ", "onchain_governance": {"onchain_governance_type": "Direct On-Chain Vote", "onchain_governance_details": "__Politeia__\nOnce a proposal is authorized a ticket-voting interval of 2,016 (~1 week) begins. To start, a snapshot of the live ticket pool is taken at 256 blocks prior to the start of voting. Every ticket in the pool when this snapshot was taken can vote \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019 on the proposal. If a ticket is called to vote on-chain during the ticket-voting interval (to validate blocks or vote on consensus rule changes), it still has until the end of the ticket-voting interval to vote on the proposal. When the voting period ends, a proposal is formally approved or rejected. In order for a vote to be considered valid there must be a quorum of 20% of the eligible tickets who vote \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019. The threshold for a proposal to be approved is 60% \u2018Yes\u2019 votes. If the proposal has a budget and deliverables attached to it the proposal owner can submit claims against the budget as deliverables are completed.\n\n__Consensus Rule Voting__\nOnce new software is released both PoW miners and PoS voters must independently adopt the software with the code changes; however, the code changes will lie dormant until the change has been voted upon.The voting period is activated once a target adoption threshold is reach for the PoW miners and PoS voters. The PoW upgrade is consdiered complete once 95% of the latest 1,000 blocks are mined with the latest version. The PoS upgrade is considered complete once 75% of the votes in a complete [stake version interval](https://docs.decred.org/glossary/#stake-version-interval-svi) (An interval which is used to determine if a vote on consensus rule changes can begin which occurs every 2,016 blocks or ~1 week) are cast using the latest version. Once both thresholds are met, voting is scheduled to begin on the first block of the next [rule change interval](https://docs.decred.org/glossary/#rule-change-interval-rci) (an interval in which ticket holders can vote on consensus rule changes that occurs every 8,064 blocks or ~4 weeks). \n\nOnce the voting period begins, ticket holders vote on the changes over a rule change interval. Every vote has a quorum requirement of 10% (voters who are not abstaining). If that requirement is met, a 75% \"Yes\" or \"No\" majority threshold is required for a vote to pass. If the outcome is \"Yes\", the consensus changes will automatically update 8,064 blocks after the vote passed. All participants in the Decred network must upgrade their software to the latest version during this window. If the outcome is \"No\", the consensus changes will never active. If the majority threshold is not met the consensus rule change will remain active for the next rule change interval. If it fails to reach an outcome again the consensus change will expire and never activate.

"Decentraland is a decentralized, traversable, three-dimensional (3D), virtual reality platform being built on the Ethereum blockchain. The platform focuses on the ownership of parcels of digital land where users can create unique environments in a virtual world. Content creators will be able to prove ownership of, and capture value from, their contributions to the platform. Users will be able to traverse unique areas of content, which can be clustered into districts, giving content creators targeted traffic and allow for spatial discovery of new content by users.\n\nCurrently, users gather, interact, share content, and play games primarily on large proprietary platforms like Facebook. The team believes that a decentralized model will allow participants to realize several benefits over current centralized services. Users and contributors will be able to benefit from transactions that occur on the platform, instead of allowing some or all of the revenue to flow to a single party. Furthermore, a decentralized platform will reduce the risk of censorship and vulnerabilities due to infrastructure failures or security breaches.\n\nDecentraland uses two tokens, LAND and MANA, which allow users to interact with the platform. Individual ownership of land parcels are represented by non-fungible LAND tokens containing the coordinates of a single point on the grid and a reference to the details of each parcel. Ownership details are managed through a ledger on a smart contract. To acquire LAND users must burn ERC20 based MANA tokens. MANA tokens are also used for the purchase of in-game goods and services.\n\nIn Dec. 2017, the first LAND tokens representing parcels in the first part of the game, Genesis City, were auctioned off. In March 2018, the Decentraland Marketplace was released allowing users to buy and sell parcels (LAND) in Genesis City as well as explore the area on a map. As of May 2018, the platform was still under development. The team plans to roll out access to the Decentraland world through a variety of devices including mobile, web and virtual reality (VR) platforms.", "issuing_organizations": []}, "roadmap": [], "regulation": {"regulatory_details": "The Securities Framework Asset Ratings of the Crypto Rating Council (CRC) attributed the score of 3.75 out of 5 to Decentraland and provided the below summary:\nSale of tokens or token interests prior to the existence of token utility\nDecentralized development and usage\nAbsence of investment-like language or marketing\n\nThe CRC is a member-owned and operated organization whose purpose is to assess if a crypto asset, or its development, issuance, and use have characteristics that make it more or less likely to implicate federal securities laws.

Following the sale, a total of 2.81 billion MANA tokens were created. Participants in the token sale received 40% of total supply (1.12 billion MANA) with a discount system that was scheduled to sell 1,000 MANA at a range of $0.024 to $0.04. Due to a small number of large investors the sale was concluded in only 35 seconds.\n\nThe development team, Decentraland Foundation, and a community reserve each received 20% of total supply (561.2 million MANA) with the founder allocation vesting over three years at semi-annual periods.\n\nAdditional MANA tokens will be released on an ongoing basis using a continuous token model. In the first year the supply will increase by 8.00% and this rate decreases over time, to 6.06% by year 5 and 4.65% by year 10. These additional tokens will be sold through a smart contract, at a price that can be updated by the Decentraland Foundation to ensure coherence with the market price of MANA. Proceeds will be used to provide ongoing financing for the Foundation.\n\nOn Dec. 15, 2017 the Genesis City auction, known as the Terraform Event, sold 90,000 parcels (LAND) in the first area of the platform. Of these, 40,000 were used to create designated community districts based on user proposals. These were priced at 1,000 MANA per LAND. The remaining supply of parcels was auctioned at the same starting rate with the requirement that each bid be 25.00% larger than the last resulting in some parcels selling for 80,000 MANA.", "general_emission_type": "Inflationary", "precise_emission_type": "Decreasing Inflation rate", "is_capped_supply": true, "max_supply": null}, "consensus": {"consensus_details": "", "general_consensus_mechanism": "n/a", "precise_consensus_mechanism": null, "targeted_block_time": null, "block_reward": null, "mining_algorithm": "n/a", "next_halving_date": null, "is_victim_of_51_percent_attack": false}}, "native_treasury": {"accounts": [], "treasury_usage_details": null}}, "technology": {"overview": {"technology_details": "Decentraland consists of the consensus, land content, and real-time layers that allow the smart contract infrastructure to link to real-time visualization and gameplay for users. \n\nThe base of the network rests on the consensus layer, where land ownership is established through the LAND smart contract and token system. Each LAND entry also contains a has that references the file containing the details of each parcel of land. \n\nFiles related to LAND entries are contained in the content layer which stores specific details of a land parcel, such descriptions of objects, textures, sounds, as well as scripts controlling how the content is placed and behaves in the parcel. Additional details such as scripts for user interaction and a link to servers for peer-to-peer interactions can be stored in these files. The platform uses IPFS network to store data and links in the consensus layer to retrieve it.\n\nUsers will interact with objects and other participants in the virtual world through the real-time layer. All interactions on this layer will be handled through peer-to-peer connections, with servers hosted by landowners or third-parties, removing the need to rely on centralized servers. \n\nThe team has released a software development kit (SDK) that will allow developers to create content within Genesis City and continues to work on integrations for identity and a payment channel infrastructure to facilitate micro-payments on the platform.

NEM\u2019s blockchain exposes its functionality through an API that can interface with any programming language instead of a specific \u201csmart contract\u201d language. \n\nA network of \"supernodes\" maintain the NEM blockchain and new tokens (XEM) are \"harvested\" instead of mined in a typical proof-of-work (PoW) way.

What made it different at the time of launch and prior to the Uniswap governance token airdrop, was SushiSwap that offered both a governance token (SUSHI) and liquidity mining. \n\nSushiSwap initially let its users stake Uniswap LP tokens on SushiSwap to earn SUSHI governance tokens. After about two weeks, SushiSwap\u2019s creator, a polarizing figure who goes by the pseudonym Chef Nomi, planned to redeem those same Uniswap LP tokens for assets that would be transferred to SushiSwap. This was coined as a vampire attack.\n\nInitially there was a large incentive to move liquidity from Uniswap to SushiSwap, which led to the spike in liquidity on Uniswap as investors chased the high yields.\n\nOn September 5th, 2020 Chef Nomi drained the development fund, swapping it for 37,400 ether, worth some $14 million at the time. SUSHI\u2019s price dropped over 70% in less than a day. The next day, facing pressure from the community, Chef Nomi turned the private key to the SushiSwap smart contract over to FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. Bankman-Fried postponed the migration, which would go on to take place on September 9th, 2020, and migrated $830 million of liquidity from Uniswap. Eventually on September 11th, 2020, facing pressure from the community, Chef Nomi voluntarily returned the ether and apologized to the community. \n\nUniswap was relatively unaffected by the SushiSwap pump and migrate \u2013 the exchange\u2019s liquidity levels returned to their prior levels following SushiSwaps liquidity migration - even increasing slightly.\n\nFollowing dubious action from Chef Nomi and its subsequent departure, the community quickly organized clear rules for ownership and control of the protocol in order to move forward in a sustainable way. The effective ownership of SuhsiSwap got split into Multisig, and Operations Multisig addresses. \n\nTo read more about Chef Nomi and SushiSwap's early history see <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/the-sushi-chronicles\">The Sushi Chronicles</a>.\n\nAnother Piece of the DeFi Puzzle\nOn November 30th, 2020, <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/andre-cronje\">Andre Cronje</a>, founder of <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/yearn-finance\">Yearn.finance</a>, announced Yearn would be merging with SushiSwap. The merger meant that Yearn and SushiSwap would share development resources, but still maintain separate tokens and governance systems. Additionally, Yearn's AMM related R&D pipeline including Deriswap would launch through SushiSwap.\n\nFor more on the Yearn-Sushi merger see Andre Conje\u2019s post.\n\nTowards a diversified DeFi institution\nThanks to aggressive liquidity mining incentives (onsen) coupled with strong branding and relentless shipping of new and innovative features, SushiSwap has become a leading decentralized exchange and a privileged venue for new projects launches.\n\nIn 2021 it plans to expand its purview into lending, options, futures, and capital markets.", "issuing_organizations": []}, "roadmap": [{"title": "MasterChef Contract Launch", "date": "2020-08-26T00:00:00Z", "type": "Mainnet Launch", "details": "MasterChef Contract"}, {"title": "Liquidity Migration + Private Key Democratization ", "date": "2020-09-09T00:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": "FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried begins the liquidity migration, where around $800 million worth of LPs tokens are used to drain value from Uniswap.

Typically, exchanges function by using an order-book where market makers set the price at which they are willing to buy and sell an asset. The difference between these prices is how they get paid for this work. SushiSwap does away entirely with the order book and instead opts to have market makers deposit assets into a pool that traders can then trade against. The price is determined algorithmically based on the proportion of the two assets being traded.\n\nPrice mechanism\nSushiSwap uses what's known as a Constant Product Market Maker that is designed to always provide liquidity regardless of the order size or amount of funds in the pool. This is achieved by asymptotically increasing the price as the size of the buy order increases, leading to potentially significant slippage on large orders. Trading pools consist of two tokens, with the product between the two sums remaining constant. Any given transaction increases one sum while decreasing the other and the price changes based on the ratio between the two. \n\nProviding liquidity\nWhen liquidity providers add to a pool, they receive newly minted liquidity tokens entitling them to their proportion of the total pool as well as the 0.25% fee generated off each trade. SUSHI stakers receive the remaining 0.05% from the 0.30% charged on ever trade. Liquidity tokens are not speculative and simply keep track of how much of the pool is owed. Liquidity providers need to supply both assets in the same proportion they are currently at, otherwise, they will change the ratio and thus price. This would result in the immediate loss of money as the price change should get arbitraged out by trading bots. Even if providers supply the correct ratio of each asset, large price changes can result in the loss of money. (Details on how this work can be found here). Therefore, providers are hoping for substantial volume of trading around the price they entered such that the fees generated account for any potential losses.\n\nThe Road Ahead:\nSushiSwap's community has big plans for 2021. Currently, SushiSwap is just an exchange, but it plans to evolve into a more diversified institution. Here are some of the products SushiSwap's community is targeting in 2021: \nDeriswap: In collaboration with Yearn, SushiSwap plans on launching Deriswap, a single liquidity pool for swaps, options, lending, and futures\nBentoBox: Planned for Q1 2021, BentoBox is a protocol that aims to create Uniswap-like (permissionless) lending markets. With BentoBox anyone will be able to create a pair, which others can borrow or lend against. Compared to Aave or Compound, this will isolate risk to specific pairs rather than the entire system. It also allows traders to build margin trading strategies around SushiSwap\nMiso (Minimal Initial Sushi Offering): Short for Minimal Initial Sushi Offering, MISO will be a token launchpad, designed to drive new projects towards launching on SushiSwap. It will include crowdsale options and functionality aimed at easing new tokens through their launch and migrating new liquidity into SushiSwap\nMirin: Mirin will bring a number of upgrades including customizable (fees, rewards, etc) franchised liquidity pools whereby traditional exchanges can offer their users the option of becoming liquidity providers through SushiSwap in what are called SubPools. Additionally Mirin will bring new LP curve options (not being locked to x * y = k), which may allow it to compete with the likes of protocols like Curve which differentiated on the basis of their LP curves. Finally Mirin will likely also feature a new impermanent loss protection & single-sided LP Solution being developed by Andre Cronje.\nMulti-chain Communication: SushiSwap will be launching on Moonbeam in 2021. Polkadot/Moonbeam will likely have a live testing version of Sushiswap in Q2\u201921E on Kusama. Additionally, SushiSwap plans to integrate with THORChain, which will enable cross-chain swaps. The idea behind it is that THORChain would support the short-tail of cryptoassets for cross-chain exchange, while SushiSwap would support long-tail assets on Ethereum\nRead more about SushiSwap's growth and where its headed in <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/valuing-sushiswap-the-grassroots-decentralized-exchange\">The Grassroots Decentralized Exchange</a>", "client_repositories": []}, "security": {"audits": [{"title": "Initial Audit By QuantStamp", "date": null, "type": "3rd Party", "details": "A security review by QuantStamp found 10 security issues with the initial SushiSwap code; none of the issues proved fatal.

After suffering an exploit in February, 2020 Andre announced he was stepping away from the project after facing backlash from the community. He later returned and the project re-branded to yEarn.finance introducing a suite of new tools such as Earn, Vaults, yInsure, and StableCredit. \n\nThe project rose to prominence after introducing its native YFI token. Prior to its launch, the protocol had around $8 million in assets under management which quickly rose to over $400m within the first week. Anyone who deposited liquidity on <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/curve\">Curve</a> yPool and YFI <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/balancer\">Balancer</a> pool within the first week of launch, was qualified to claim YFI. This generated a lot of attention to yEarn.finance and its launch mechanism has helped develop the dApps into an active community, particularly since there were no allocations to the team or investors, meaning it is governed entirely by users. \n\nMultisig Governance\nInitially, Andre had the exclusive ability to mint tokens but that privilege was later extended to 9 multi-sig owners requiring 6 signatures. These members are active members in the DeFi community and Andre did not include himself as a signatory. \n\nVaults Launch\nIn Yearn.Finance V2, the team launched a new product called Vaults. It is essentially a smart savings account that maximizes the value accrual of deposited assets. yUSD is the first vault that launched and it reached ~$600M within days. The success of yUSD sparked the community to innovate more on this product, and in the end, yETH was born. yETH vault created so much hype, on the first day alone, users deposited ~$140M worth of ethers. This event triggered <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/maker\">Maker</a>(the protocol who made <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/dai\">DAI</a>, a key component in yETH accumulation strategy) to increase the debt ceiling in DAI. At the time of writing, The vault still closed temporarily, citing that the current asset under management is sufficient for risk and rewards returns.\n\n", "issuing_organizations": []}, "roadmap": [], "regulation": {"regulatory_details": null, "sfar_score": null, "sfar_summary": null}}, "contributors": {"individuals": [{"slug": "andre-cronje", "first_name": "Andre", "last_name": "Cronje", "title": "Founder of yearn.finance", "description": null, "avatar_url": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1600905600%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DehFJsjyKaXkFkNNg3EvVGvl5asxFYuJRWY8_y_DruY8"}], "organizations": []}, "advisors": {"individuals": [], "organizations": []}, "investors": {"individuals": [], "organizations": [{"slug": "delphi-digital", "name": "Delphi Digital", "logo": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/iNTyjk96_400x400.jpg", "description": "Delphi Digital is an independent research and consulting boutique specializing in the digital asset market."}, {"slug": "framework-ventures", "name": "Framework Ventures", "logo": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/ED55B358-Vk1MujPn_400x400.jpg", "description": "Framework Ventures is a team of technologists, researchers, and investors who invest and participate in open crypto networks.

Essentially, there are 3 ways to earn yield in V1 yEarn.finance:\nLending: assets are lent out via lenders such as Aave, Compound, and dYdX\nTrading: assets provided to Uniswap, Balancer, and Curve earn trading fees.\nLiquidity incentives: protocols such as Compound, Balancer, and Curve provide liquidity incentives, they provide additional incentives for liquidity\n\nVaults\nThe launch of Vaults kickoff the yEarn.Finance V2. Vaults allow users to deposit stablecoin or selected tokens in a pool managed by on-chain yield farming strategy. The big idea of Vaults is to democratize yield farming since high gas cost prevents the masses from farming yields, Vaults are exactly designed to combat high entry barriers to yield farming hence effectively allowing gas cost to be subsidized by economies of scale. The platform charges performance fees and withdrawal fees, these fees are distributed to governance, strategy creator, and the protocol treasury.\nThere are 3 main components that compose Vaults:\nyVault: a simple token container to wrap the underlying assets into y token, for example ETH to yETH.\nController: A subset of governance selected to manage and oversee each vault strategy.\nStrategies: a set of instructions to maximize the underlying assets in a lossless way as possible.\n\nEach vault strategy is proposed by the strategist and voted by the governance. In Vaults V1, the strategy usually involves depositing underlying assets to the money market platform(<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/aave\">Aave</a>,<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/compound\"> Compound</a>) and borrowing stablecoin against it, the stablecoin then deposited back to yEarn.Finance stablecoin vault to earn more yields. The profits generated from each respective vault are used to purchase more of the underlying asset in each vault.\n\nHowever, the higher the deposited amount, the more inflexible the vault becomes hence lowering the yields. This general strategy is difficult to scale to different assets. As a result, the community suggested a more flexible vault where each vault has multiple strategies depending on the risk appetite of the users. Additionally, the V2 design will also make it easier and safer for developers to integrate Vaults into their projects. The app is live at https://yearn.finance/vaults\n\nyInsure\nyInsure is a pooled insurance that provides coverage from financial loss because of smart contract bugs and various risks underwritten by<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/nexus-mutual\"> Nexus Mutual</a>. Unlike Nexus Mutual, in order to own the token, the user doesn\u2019t need to be KYC\u2019d. Additionally, the token is also transferable as it is in the form of<a href=\"https://messari.io/article/nfts-meet-defi-the-emergence-of-nft-loans\"> NFT</a>(Non-Fungible Token - ERC721). Each deposit to the insured vault is charged with 0.1% initiation fees and 0.01% for ongoing weeks. All subject to change by YFI governance.\n\nThe way yInsure works is there are 3 actors in the system:\nInsurer vault: the liquidity provider that provides insurance\nInsured vault: hold the asset that is being insured, subject to initiation and weekly fees\nClaim governance: allowing insured vault holders to claim their insurance\n\nOther than providing liquidity, the insurer is also responsible for claim management. For this reason, they are rewarded with the fees paid by the insured so the incentives within the parties involved are aligned. The app is live at https://yinsure.finance/\n\nStableCredit\nStableCredit works similarly to the multi-collateral model of<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/maker\"> MakerDAO</a>, but the difference here is you can deposit any assets you want as collateral and get a credit line once the asset is deposited. It is essentially a lender, mixed with<a href=\"https://messari.io/article/the-bull-case-for-automated-market-makers-tokens\"> automatic market makers</a> that do dynamic utilization ratio(credit line) so it can keep up with the amount of credit the user\u2019s borrowed based on the collaterals the user provides. This product is currently in the research and development phase.\n\nyTrade\nyTrade is a leveraged stablecoin exchange. It enables users to borrow stable assets with up to 1000x leverage, users deposit one or more stable assets as collateral and it will receive another wrapped stable assets that incorporate leverage ranging from 75x to 1000x. \n\nAs we know, stable coins sometimes went off their peg. This product is useful for traders who want to arbitrage between stablecoin but don\u2019t have the capital to conduct profitable arbitrage trades. This product is currently in the research and development phase.\n\nyLeverage\nAllowing arbitrageurs to short up to 5x stablecoins with another stable coin in order to reach its pegs. This product is currently in the research and development phase.\n\nyLiquidate\nA liquidation bot that monitors<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/aave\"> Aave</a> protocol, it allows anyone to call the contract, paying back part of the debt owed and receiving discounted collateral in return. This product is currently in the research and development phase but can be used here\n\nDelegated Funding DAO Vaults\nYFI holders can provide capital to DAOs that are listed in the DAO Vaults ecosystem.

It aims to address the scalability issues present in existing blockchains where the cost to verify the blockchain grows proportionally with total transaction throughput. In these cases, the cost of running a network node eventually exceeds the resources available to most real-world users.\n\nThe goal of Mina is to design a decentralized payment system that offers efficient verification of system history from genesis without relying on any external advice. This is achieved by the following properties:\nA formal notion of a \u201csuccinct blockchain\u201d\nGeneric functionalities modeled as replicated state machines using incrementally computable SNARKs\nConcrete implementation of a payments system called Mina\nOuroboros Samasika, a provably-secure PoS consensus protocol that is adaptively secure and offers bootstrapping from genesis.\nParallel scan state to improve transaction confirmation time beyond the limits otherwise imposed by the proof construction.\nPerformance evaluation report of executing the protocol involving a public community.", "official_links": [{"name": "Ouroboros Praos WhitePaper", "link": "https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/573"}, {"name": "Website", "link": "https://minaprotocol.com/"}, {"name": "Twitter", "link": "https://twitter.com/MinaProtocol"}, {"name": "Medium", "link": "https://medium.com/minaprotocol"}, {"name": "Technical Whitepaper ", "link": "https://minaprotocol.com/static/pdf/technicalWhitepaper.pdf"}, {"name": "Economic Whitepaper ", "link": "https://minaprotocol.com/static/pdf/economicsWhitepaper.pdf "}]}, "background": {"background_details": "\nThe project began in mid-2017. Evan Shapiro and Izaak wanted to make a protocol that could effectively be both decentralized and scalable. Izaak was studying cryptography at Berkeley for a PhD at the time and learning about zkSNARKs.\n\nTheir thesis argued that it\u2019s difficult for the average end-user to access Ethereum without trusting a third party that runs a full node. Ethereum developers tend to use services like Infura or Alchemy for app development. o(1) Labs, the development firm behind Mina, regarded these as centralization points that 1) make the underlying blockchain less trustworthy and 2) create an unideal user interface and developer experience. The team wanted to keep storage costs low on Mina so that anyone could run a full node.\n\nThe team believes that Mina has a chance at succeeding where prior blockchains have not: as a payments use-case. They\u2019re making Mina more accessible to developers\u2014potential to run a full node inside of a web app or an IoT device\u2014so they hope to see many diverse use-cases.\n\nMina uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism known as Ouroboros Praos to reach consensus, which builds off prior work published by IOHK, one of the companies developing Cardano. It was designed to be simple and allow anyone to participate proportionally to the amount of stake in the protocol. Bandwidth requirements are low to facilitate a high level of inclusivity. \n\nOn Oct. 24, 2019, Corda blockchain developer R3 filed a lawsuit against (o)1 Labs over the Coda Protocol name, claiming it was too similar to R3's Corda trademark.

This means the complexity to verify the chain is independent of its' size preserving the ease with which users can actively participate in the network. Rather than preserving the whole chain, a user simply needs to hold onto the current state using a SNARK (succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge) to certify its' existence. \n\nThis allows

The long-term goal of the team is to transition to a fully decentralized exchange model. \n\nCurrently, the exchange operates through more of a centralized model, attempting to duplicate best practices in traditional asset exchanges including dedicated risk and compliance teams. These teams are responsible for internal controls and cross-departmental reviews aimed at reducing fraudulent activity on the platform.\n\nKuCoin Shares (KCS) is a token used to reward users and attract new customers to the exchange. Users holding a specified amount of KCS in their account are eligible for discounts on trading fees. Furthermore, holders of KCS receive a daily dividend, called a KuCoin bonus, equal to 50% of trading fees on the exchange. Those that have referred new users to the platform are eligible to receive 40% of fees while the exchange retains the remaining 10%. Dividends are paid in whichever token was the most traded during the day.\n\nTo encourage referrals, each user receives a registration link they can share. Referral bonuses are paid for both direct and indirect activity. Users receive bonuses for both the activity of their direct referrals as well as the activity from any new users their referrals add to the platform. Users holding enough KCS in their exchange account receive a discount on trading fees. KCS held off-exchange is not eligible for this rebate program. Additional benefits such as a personal investment consultation and expedited customer service are offered to users on a tiered basis as they increase their KCS holdings.\n\nWhile trading rebates and referrals are the current use case for KCS KuCoin plans to use the token for transaction fees once they launch a fully decentralized platform.

Micro-transactions are supported through a multi-firewall private network built on Amazon Web Services. KuCoin employees are provided with a unique cipher code to initiate withdrawals from the wallet. Longer term holdings are stored in bank custody with multiple signatures via independent private keys required to access them.\n\nWithdrawal requests are first inspected using an internal artificial intelligence algorithm designed to process transactions instantly while still maintaining risk and security measures. KuCoin also offers multifactor authentication for transactions. \n\nKuCoin hopes to release a feature whereby exchange participants can self-register new cryptocurrency pairs and start trading automatically to help reach the goal of having 1,000 tokens listed and a daily exchange volume exceeding 100,000 BTC by December 2018. \n\nTokens that fail to meet ongoing listing standards are not immediately delisted on the exchange but are instead put under special treatment rules. Projects may fall under this classification if they are likely to cease activities during the next three months, fail to have enough volume to make markets, appear insolvent, fail an audit, fail to report details in a timely fashion, engage in malicious market activities, dissolve the founding team, or any other reason at the discretion of KuCoin. \n\nProjects in special treatment are designated as such on the platform, so exchange participants are aware the associated token is a candidate for delisting. \n\nAt the end of the observation, period tokens are delisted if they continue not to meet the volume required for listing or the project does not take the necessary actions to remedy the reason special treatment was applied.

It launched as Enigma, a project founded in 2017 to bring a second-layer private computation solution to Ethereum. The Enigma team announced the network's launch on the same day it revealed its <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/enigma-settles-with-sec-over-45-million-ico\">settlement</a> with the U.S. SEC over Enigma's $45 million ICO in 2017. The project later rebranded to Secret Network in May 2020. Enigma MPC (the company behind the original Enigma protocol) is now one of several development groups that contribute to Secret Network's underlying technology.\n\nUnlike Enigma's initial vision, Secret Network is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol built using the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint consensus engine featuring the native token SCRT. The launch of Secret Network was assisted by over 20 validators supporting the network. The next critical step in the ecosystem occurred in early June with the creation of the Secret Foundation, an organization established to promote the growth and adoption of the Secret Network ecosystem. The Secret Foundation advocates for privacy as a public good and helps provide tools, technologies, education, and support necessary to preserve user privacy.\n\nOn Jun. 20, 2020, the Secret Games Incentivized Testnet began and ran for almost two months. Over 100 users participated in the event. This testnet event enabled Secret Network developers to stress test the chain in a live adversarial environment in preparation for the \u201cVulcan\u201d hard fork upgrade, which eventually enabled smart contracts (or Secret Contracts) on mainnet.\n\nENG Token Swap & Wallet Support\nOn Jun. 24, 2020, the burn contract for SCRT was initiated. This burn contract enabled owners of ERC-20 token ENG to convert their cryptocurrency to SCRT. Since then, approximately 62 million SCRT have been sent from the burn contract. Another 35+ million SCRT were swapped by Binance on Sep. 29, 2020. Binance later became the first major exchange to list SCRT for trading. SCRT holders were able to participate in governance and staking, and they could also use their tokens to execute secret contracts.\n\nThe Keplr and MathWallet wallets support Secret Network and SCRT tokens. Secret Network's governance proposal #19 saw SCRT holders vote to fund the team behind the Keplr wallet (using funds from the Secret community pool) to create a MetaMask UX equivalent for the Secret Network. This wallet would eventually add support for Secret Contracts and applications.\n\nSecret Contracts & Applications\nOn Sep. 15, 2020, the Secret Network successfully hard forked and upgraded the protocol from \u201csecret-1\u201d to \u201csecret-2\u201d. This upgrade enabled Secret Contracts (smart contracts with privacy by default). On Dec. 4, 2021, the Secret Network reached fifty active validators. The Secret Ethereum Bridge launched on Dec. 15, 2021, which Secret Network developers say will be the first of many bridges to other ecosystems. This bridge allowed users to wrap Ethereum and fourteen other ERC-20s to their Secret Network equivalents (which operate under the SNIP-20 standard). Over two million SCRT were offered up as bridge mining rewards to encourage liquidity and adoption.\n\nSecretSwap, Secret Network's first major application-layer DeFi application, launched on Mar. 31, 2021. It is a privacy-first, cross-chain Automated Market Maker (AMM) protocol. Since Secret Swap uses secret contracts, it has the following features:\nFront-Running Prevention: Inputs in the mempool are encrypted, which means miners can\u2019t extract value by reordering or frontrunning your transactions\nPrivacy: As inputs to a swap contract are encrypted, users data and transactions remain private assuming more than one address executes a swap each block", "issuing_organizations": []}, "roadmap": [{"title": "Mainnet Launch", "date": "2020-02-13T00:00:00Z", "type": "Mainnet Launch", "details": "The Secret Network mainnet launched on Feb. 13, 2020, in collaboration with initial block signers and validators from across its ecosystem.

More precisely, the Secret Network currently uses Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX), which is a set of instructions that increase the security of application code and data, giving them more protection from disclosure or modification.\n\nAs requested by SGX technology, the Secret Network Protocol code is partitioned into trusted and untrusted parts. The trusted part contains sensitive data and it is executed inside an \u201cenclave,\u201d which is a term referring to the secure component of a Trusted Execution Environment. The untrusted part includes the rest of the code, along with code for managing the enclave (load and destroy).", "client_repositories": [{"name": "Secret Network", "link": "https://github.com/enigmampc/secretnetwork", "license_type": " AGPL-3.0"}]}, "security": {"audits": [], "known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities": []}}, "governance": {"governance_details": "Secret Network primarily relies on its on-chain, token-weighted governance system to determine valid proposals and execute changes. It also uses an off-chain component that allows core contributors and community members to suggest and discuss potential changes before they reach an official proposal stage. If a suggestion receives enough support from the community, there's a good chance it could end up as an on-chain proposal.\n\nGovernance and proposal discussions take place in the Secret Network forum. The list of ongoing and past on-chain governance proposals is available on the Secret Nodes block explorer.", "onchain_governance": {"onchain_governance_type": "Delegated On-Chain Vote", "onchain_governance_details": "Secret Network allows any SCRT staker (validators or delegators) to submit protocol improvement proposals and vote on them to determine their outcome. Voting power is proportional to the amount of SCRT a staker has bonded to the network.\n\nThe network's [on-chain governance system](https://scrt.network/blog/secret-network-governance/) consists of a few key features that derive from the Cosmos SDK governance module:\n- __Proposal Submission:__ Users can submit proposals to the Secret Network with a deposit. Once the minimum deposit is reached, the proposal enters a voting period.\n- __Vote:__ Participants can vote on proposals that reached the MinDeposit threshold. There are four types of votes: Yes, No, NoWithVeto, and Abstain. NoWithVeto counts as No but also adds a Veto. The Abstain option allows voters to signal that they do not vote in favor or against the proposal but accept the result of the vote.\n- __Inheritance and Penalties:__ Delegators inherit their validator\u2019s vote if they do not submit a vote themselves.\n- __Claiming Deposit:__ Users that deposited on proposals can recover their deposits so long as the proposal was not denied with a No with Veto. Deposits are recoverable if the proposal never entered a voting period.\n\nThe process for submitting and voting on a proposal is as follows:\n\n1. __Deposits:__ For a proposal to be considered for voting, a minimum deposit of 1000 SCRT must be deposited within one week from when the proposal was submitted. Any SCRT holder may contribute to this deposit to support proposals, meaning the party submitting the proposal doesn\u2019t necessarily need to provide the deposit itself. The deposit is required as spam protection. If the proposal does not reach the minimum deposit threshold, deposits are refunded. If the proposal is approved or if it\u2019s rejected but not vetoed, deposits will automatically be refunded to their respective depositor. When a proposal is vetoed with a supermajority, deposits will be burned.\n2. __Voting:__ When the minimum deposit for a particular proposal is reached, the 1-week voting period begins. During this period, SCRT holders are able to cast their vote on that proposal. As mentioned, there are four voting options: Yes, No, NoWithVeto, and Abstain. Note that (1) only staked tokens can participate in governance, (2) voting power is measured in terms of stake. The amount of SCRT you stake determines your influence on the decision, and (3) delegators inherit the vote of the validators they are delegated to unless they cast their own vote, which will overwrite validator decisions.\n3. __Tallying:__ Whether a proposal is accepted depends on the result of the coin voting by SCRT holders. For a proposal to be considered accepted, it must reach a quorum (more than 33.4% of the total staked tokens at the end of the voting period need to have participated in the vote), pass an approval threshold (more than 50% of the tokens that participated in the vote (after excluding Abstain votes) voted in favor of the proposal), and not be vetoed (fewer than 33.4% of the tokens that participated in the vote (after excluding Abstain votes) vetoed the decision)\n4. __Implementation:__ An accepted proposal is really nothing without being implemented as part of the software that is run by validators in the network. If a proposal is just offering direction (\u201csignaling\u201d), developers can bake it into a hard fork proposal and pass it to the validators to update the network.", "is_treasury_decentralized":

The team sought to combine the merits of these protocols to create a decentralized perpetual contract trading protocol on Ethereum. The protocol is capable of supporting 20x leverage, short positions, and lower slippage compared to other AMMs thanks to its virtual AMM (vAMM) design.\n\nUnlike well known Automated Market Makers used for both token swaps and price discovery, the vAMM is solely used for price discovery to handle leverage and short positions.

With most AMMs, a user can deposit two assets into a pool which are represented as x and y in the well-known constant product formula pioneered by <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/uniswap/profile\">Uniswap</a>:\nx  y = k\nThe product of the available quantities of the two assets establishes the price a user would pay to swap in either direction. Given the simplicity of the formula,  as the supply of one asset increases, the supply of the second asset decreases resulting in a constant value of k. Perpetual Protocol\u2019s vAMM follows a similar concept except the assets are never stored inside the AMM and the protocol uses the constant product formula solely for price discovery, not for spot trading.\n\nThe \u201cvirtual\u201d part of the name comes from the fact that there are no real assets (x and y) stored inside the vAMM. Instead, the assets are sent to the \u201cClearing House\u201d, a smart contract that accepts deposits and records position ownership such as initial margin, level of leverage, and the direction of the position. Upon receiving the funds, the Clearing House deposits them in the \u201cVault\u201d which manages all of the collateral backing the vAMM.\n\nFunding Rate\nIn contrast to AMMs that rely on arbitrageurs to continually execute trades to ensure asset prices in the AMM track closely the rest of the market, Perpetual\u2019s vAMM utilizes an hourly funding rate where at the top of each hour, funding payments are paid to incentivize traders to take the unpopular side of a trade to bring the price of the contract back in line with the index price. The protocol follows the following formula to compute the funding payments:\nfunding payment  = position size  funding rate\nWhere the position size is computed as the notional value of the position (number of contracts multiplied by the price of the asset) and the funding rate is calculated as the difference between the time-weighted average price (TWAP) of the contract and the TWAP of the index divided by 24.\nfunding rate = (TWAP perpetual - TWAP index) / 24\nFollowing the above formula, if the funding rate is positive (TWAP of the perpetual contract is greater than the TWAP of the index) the long position holders pay the funding payment to the short position holders, and vice versa if the rate is negative. The payments between longs and shorts happen at the end of each hour, which is similar to a conventional future contract expiring once per day.\n\nThe team decided to source the index price from Chainlink because they believe it's the \u201cmost battle-tested Oracle solution on the market\u201d.\n\nInsurance Fund\nHalf of the transaction fees on Perpetual Protocol are deposited into an Insurance Fund, which acts as the first line of defense when the system is hit with unexpected losses coming from losses in the liquidation process or funding payments. If the Insurance Fund is depleted, the protocol will mint new PERP tokens and immediately sell them for collateral in the Vault to keep the system solvent.\n\n", "client_repositories": []}, "security": {"audits": [], "known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities": []}}, "governance": {"governance_details": "Currently, the governance of the protocol is handled by the core developer team to keep the decision-making process fast and nimble.

The project also integrated Ethereum's virtual machine (the EVM) so the chain could run Turing complete code needed to support smart contracts, and thus decentralized applications (dApps). Qtum's stack features a middleware layer, dubbed the account abstraction layer (AAL), to ensure the UTXO set was compatible with the smart contract execution layer.

Prior to founding Qtum, Patric was a member of the Alibaba team while Neil Mahi came in with 20 years of software development experience. Both founders had spent multiple years working with cryptoassets before pursuing Qtum.\n\nMarrying aspects of Bitcoin and Ethereum\nQtum aims to harness the best attributes of the <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoinhttps://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> and <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> blockchains to create a smart contracting platform. The protocol uses the Bitcoin core code as its base for security and stability reasons. Since Bitcoin does not support Turing complete smart contracts, Qtum integrated Ethereum's virtual machine (dubbed the Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM) to make the network capable of running decentralized applications (dApps). It also has plans to integrate additional virtual machines, namely the X86 VM, to support smart contract programming languages beyond Solidity.\n\nThe combination of Bitcoin and Ethereum attributes creates a compatibility issue. Bitcoin uses a UTXO model to track coin ownership, while Ethereum (like most other protocols sporting virtual machines) employs an account-based model for simplicity. The Qtum tech stack, therefore, contains a conversion layer, called the account abstraction layer (AAL), in between Bitcoin code and the EVM to ensure UTXO and virtual machine compatibility.\n\nPoS consensus and on-chain governance\nQtum opted to use an adaptation of Blackcoin's Poof-of-Stake (PoS) model as its consensus mechanism. The team believed Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain protocols suffered from categorical scaling limitations that PoS could help alleviate. Qtum also has an on-chain governance system (aka Decentralized Governance Protocol or DGP) to pass on decision-making responsibilities to token holders. Network parameters up for discussion include block size and base gas fee, among others. In addition to the on-chain governance system, the Qtum Foundation plays a central role in the development and promotion of the Qtum blockchain.", "issuing_organizations": []}, "roadmap": [],

In short, validators stake tokens (i.e. lock up tokens in escrow) in order to validate transactions and produce blocks. The likelihood of being chosen to produce a block is proportional to the number of tokens one has staked on the network (each new coin staked reduces the difficulty of producing the next block to a point). By design, PoS incorporates a slashing penalty (i.e., coin confiscation) to disincentivize participants form trying to game the system. Qtum opted for PoS because it believes PoW is energy-intensive, wasteful, and unsustainable. \n\nCoin maturity\nUnlike some other PoS chains, Qtum does not have a minimum staking requirements. This strategy can encourage widespread participation (thus increasing the decentralization of validators), but it means consensus participants have less of an incentive to remain honest. Qtum addresses this challenge through its coin maturity mechanism, which requires staking tokens to \"mature\" (i.e., staked for at least 500 blocks) to participate in block production and receive staking rewards.\n\nThe Qtum network produces a 2 MB block every 120 seconds (two minutes). Each block rewards the validator with a total of 4 newly minted QTUM, but these stakers only receive 0.4 QTUM once the block is created. The protocol locks the remaining 3.6 QTUM until the initial 0.4 reward has reached maturity (which, as mentioned, takes 500 blocks).

DGP will be able to issue approved changes via a soft fork (whenever possible), thereby preventing any network disruptions often seen during hard fork upgrades. More significant upgrades that would require a hard fork to implement would instead go through Qtum's off-chain governance process.\n\nThere are four steps to the DGP process:\n\n1. A network participant or group of stakeholders creates a proposal that aims to change a specific network parameter\n2. All governance participants vote on the proposal\n3.

Initial team members included Xinshu Dong, Yaoqi Jia, Amrit Kumar, and Prateek Saxena (who previously worked with Loi Luu, CEO and Co-Founder of Kyber Network), among others. They incorporated the company behind Zilliqa (called Zilliqa Research) in Jun. 2017, a few months before the team launched its first testnet.\n\nZilliqa brings the theory of sharding to practice with a protocol that aims to address the scalability limitations seen in some other blockchains. Its sharded design allows concurrent chains to execute transactions in parallel, thereby increasing the overall capacity of the network. The team\u2019s primary motivation in building this product was to create a platform that could process <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/smart-contracts\">smart contracts</a> at scale without sacrificing core blockchain principles, such as the decentralization of node management.\n\nZilliqa uses a modified version of the <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/proof-of-work\">Proof-of-Work</a> (PoW) consensus protocol to order and validate transactions, as well as provide security assurances for completed transactions.

When Zilliqa's mainnet launched in January 2019, block rewards were split into base rewards (25%) for all validating nodes in the network and flexible rewards (70%) that are based on the amount of valid and accepted signatures submitted by a node during a transaction epoch. The last 5% of rewards are allocated to the lookup and seed nodes. The entirety of the Mining rewards are already pre-mined and will be distributed over a ten-year period.\n\nSeed Node Staking Changes\nIn June 2020, Zilliqa introduced a new staking contract (via ZIP-3), which allows Seed Nodes to distribute their percentage of the block reward to direct or delegate stakers. There were only ten seed nodes when the contract went leive, and each one was eligible to receive enough delegate tokens to stake up to 61 million tokens. Therefore, the number of tokens available for staking in first phase of Zilliqa's new staking contract tops out at 610 million ZIL. \n\nWhen ZIP-3 launched, Seed Nodes continued to receive 5% of all block rewards, a portion of which they passed down to delegate stakers in proportion to the number of tokens locked up. But in November 2020, Zilliqa executed ZIP-9 to overhaul the distribution block rewards. Under this new policy, miners only 60% of block rewards while the remaining share goes to Seed Nodes and their delegates. Zilliqa increase the rewards for stakers to incentivize more stakers to join the network. The Zilliqa also increased the block reward by 40% to offset any losses suffered by miners due to the new block reward split. Therefore, the network will now reach its maximum supply much sooner than originally intended.", "general_emission_type": "Inflationary", "precise_emission_type": "Fixed Inflation rate", "is_capped_supply": true, "max_supply": 21000000000}, "consensus": {"consensus_details": "Zilliqa\u2019s network consists of several groups of nodes, each called a shard. A special shard among these is referred to as a Directory Service (DS) committee. The DS committee acts as a supervisory shard and helps in the formation of shards and aggregate transaction validation results from each shard among others.\n\nZilliqa leverages on the shards for parallel processing of transactions. Each shard and the DS committee run an optimized practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT) for consensus on valid transactions.\n\nNOTE: In pBFT, there is a deterministic finality of blocks, unlike the probabilistic finality in <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/nakamoto-consensus\">Nakamoto consensus</a> (like <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\">$BTC</a>). Therefore, there is no need for several block confirmation, the latest state of the latest block is the \u201ctruth\u201d of the chain.\n\nZilliqa miners receive block rewards based on how many valid signatures they contributed. According to the team, this makes ZIL rewards low-variance and potentially allows for a more equal distribution of tokens by way of block rewards.\n\nLearn more:\nZilliqa Mining Guide\nNode Explorer (ViewBlock Zilliqa block explorer)", "general_consensus_mechanism": "Other", "precise_consensus_mechanism": "Proof-of-Work & pBFT", "targeted_block_time": 43, "block_reward": null, "mining_algorithm": "Ethash", "next_halving_date": null, "is_victim_of_51_percent_attack": false}}, "native_treasury": {"accounts": [], "treasury_usage_details": null}}, "technology": {"overview": {"technology_details": "Zilliqa focuses on scalability through a process called sharding. While many current blockchain applications utilize every node on a network to process every transaction, Zilliqa divides the network into different shards, each processing a subset of the network\u2019s transactions and requiring only some miners working on those transactions at any given time. This reduces wasted computational resources related to nodes confirming transactions that may have already been verified by thousands of others. \n\nSharding is also applied to smart contract processing, in that only subsets of the entire network resources are used to perform any given computation. Using this technology Zilliqa expects their throughput to roughly double with the addition of every couple hundred miners. \n\nZilliqa uses standard <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\">Proof-of-Work (PoW)</a> for security in its network, but it has a two-layer blockchain structure to allow for more efficient use of computing resources. To create an identity or participate in sharding on a user must show proof-of-work but this is not used to achieve consensus. Instead, Zilliqa employs a consensus protocol known as practical Byzantine fault tolerance. In this protocol, nodes are grouped with a leader that is responsible for broadcasting both transactions and decisions. When two-thirds of nodes in a shard cast their votes, the leader commits an answer. Leader nodes are changed continuously to prevent malicious leaders from having an undue effect on the network. \n\nUnlike Ethereum, Zilliqa does not have a Turing-complete smart contract language. Their smart contract language Scilla was designed with safety in mind and is amenable to formal verification. Zilliqa cites neural nets as being a prime example of a computation that would be best served by their language, as on any other network it would likely be prohibitively expensive. \n\nIn the future, Zilliqa plans to research on a significant number of new technologies including: \nState sharding \u2013 Allowing the data stored by the network to be divided in the same way as the processing and consensus layers. \nSecure Proof-of-Stake (SPoS) \u2013 A security mechanism that distributes consensus power to the most heavily invested nodes in the network. \nStorage pruning \u2013 A mechanism for reducing the total amount of data required to store in order to participate in the network. This can eliminate spam and dated blocks from the required data. \nPrivacy-preserving computation \u2013 Computation that removes the identity requirement of participating in the network, so computation is not tied to an account on the blockchain\n", "client_repositories": [{"name": "Zilliqa", "link": "\"https://github.com/Zilliqa/Zilliqa\t\"\t\t", "license_type": "GPL v3.0"}]}, "security": {"audits": [{"title": "ERC20 contract audit 1", "date": null, "type": null, "details": "[https://docs.zilliqa.com/ZKLabs-Zilliqa-Audit.pdf](https://docs.zilliqa.com/ZKLabs-Zilliqa-Audit.pdf)"}, {"title": "ERC20 contract audit 2", "date": null, "type": null, "details": "[https://docs.zilliqa.com/ChainSecurity-Zilliqa-Audit.pdf](https://docs.zilliqa.com/ChainSecurity-Zilliqa-Audit.pdf)"}, {"title": "Zilliqa core security audit", "date": null, "type": null, "details": "N/A"}], "known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities": []}}, "governance": {"governance_details": "Rough consensus is mainly driven by Zilliqa Research and core developers.\n\nSee the Zilliqa governance discussion Discord channel for the latest updates.", "onchain_governance": {"onchain_governance_type": "No On-Chain Governance", "onchain_governance_details": null, "is_treasury_decentralized": false}, "grants": [{"funding_organizations": [], "grant_program_details": "Zilliqa's ecosystem arm, ZILHive, has a pool of $5 million, which it uses to issue grants to projects, teams, and individuals building on the Zilliqa blockchain.

Celsius aims to provide a fully community-oriented alternative to traditional financial institutions. \n\nAfter succeeding at raising $50M from its ICO in march 2018, and after a year of building and developing its product, the team launched the Celsius Wallet in early 2019. It allows users to deposit coins as collateral to get loans in dollars, and lend their crypto to earn interest.\n\nSince inception, the platform has experienced significant growth : the number of active users grew by around 800% in the first year, and is showing an average weekly growth of 3.06% since launch.\u00a0As of February 2021, Celsius has acquired more than 400,000 users, and holds more than $9Bn in community deposits.\n\nAttractive features for retail deposits and CeFi borrowing\nWith about 90% of the deposits coming from retail clients, and close to 100% of the borrowers being institutions, the business model of Celsius revolves around lending retail money to institutional hands.\n\nFor retail users, the Celsius Network offers high interest-bearing savings accounts, low interest borrowing credit lines and a payment system. On top of <a href=\"https://messari.io/Applications/Joplin.app/Contents/:/app/source\">subsidising</a> the service with a fee-less experience on financial services, Celsius gives attractive rewards to its community, 80% of loan interest flowing back to pay depositors.\n\nTo generate revenue,Celsius Network lends deposits and coins to\u00a0CeFi Financial Institutions: large investors, institutional traders, hedge funds or exchanges.\n\nCommunity-centric tokenomics\nRetail and Institutional users are all incentivised to take part in the community by using the CEL token since the network is designed for the Celsius community to share a portion (80%) of the profit generated. In addition, the CEL token allows access to community membership and increased rewards.\n\nConcerns and regulatory risks surrounding institutional loans, and funding of margin trading program\nBut there is rising concern surrounding the use of user funds.\u00a0Celsius states that it lends to hedge funds, institutional traders, and exchanges to earn interest, however, the firm does not make clear that it also lends to margin traders through margin trading programs run by some exchanges. This implies that Celsius lends directly to customers on some exchange through their peer to peer margin trading program; if anything happens to the exchanges themselves, lenders, including Celsius, may face default risks as well.\n", "issuing_organizations": []}, "roadmap": [{"title": "Inception", "date": null, "type": null, "details": "Concept formulated by Alex Mashinsky and initial team assembled during Q2-Q3 2017."}, {"title": "Whitepaper", "date": null, "type": null, "details": "Version 1 of Whitepaper is released, tech team hired and development begins."}, {"title": "Public crowdsale", "date": "2018-03-15T00:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": "The CEL token was launched for public sale on March 2018, the team raised $50m.\nAdditional information about the sale :\nICO Token Price: 1 CEL = 0.3 USD\nTotal Tokens: 650,000,000\nAvailable for Token Sale: 50%"}, {"title": "Celsius Network 1.0 ", "date": "2018-01-01T00:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": "The Celsius Wallet is launched, including the Dollar borrows feature, allowing users to deposit crypto assets in wallet to use as collateral for loans."}, {"title": "Celsius Network 2.0", "date": "2019-04-01T00:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": "Celsius Network version 2.0 is released, allowing users to earn interest on their crypto deposits."}, {"title": "Celsius Network version 3.0", "date": "2019-06-01T00:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": "Overall updates and improvement in retail user experience : \n\nA wallet \u201cfacelift\u201d: aesthetic enhancements.

It will also be used in the tokenomics of all future protocols developed by the 1inch Network.", "official_links": [{"name": "Official Website", "link": "https://1inch.io/"}, {"name": "Twitter", "link": "https://twitter.com/1inch"}, {"name": "Reddit", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/1inch/"}, {"name": "YouTube", "link": " https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk0nvK4bHpteQXZKv7lkq5w"}, {"name": "Discord", "link": "https://discord.com/invite/zryxZZypYt"}, {"name": "Telegram", "link": "https://t.me/OneInchNetwork"}, {"name": "Medium", "link": "https://blog.1inch.io/"}, {"name": "Github", "link": "https://github.com/1inch"}]}, "background": {"background_details": "\nInitial Conception\nThe 1inch Network was founded in May 2019 by Serjez Kunz and Anton Bukov, two Russian developers with backgrounds in smart contract security. Both Kunz and Bukov attended ETHNewYork's Hackathon where they were experimenting with arbitrage bots and strategy. At the ETH NY hackathon  the pair developed their first product, the 1inch Aggregation Protocol. Like its name suggests, the aggregation protocol is a DEX aggregator that searches for trades across multiple different markets, offering better rates than any individual exchange. The protocol initially sourced liquidity from Bancor, Kyber, and Uniswap. Since then, the 1inch Network has raised roughly $14.8 million in funding and grown to support nearly 80 different markets across multiple chains.\n\nMooniSwap to Now\nIn August of 2020, 1inch launched Mooniswap, otherwise known as the 1inch Liquidity Protocol. Mooniswap was dubbed a next-generation Automatic Market Maker (AMM) built to prevent front-running. The DEX introduced a five-minute price delay, creating a more competitive environment for arbitrageurs, forcing them to take trades at less profitable prices. Theoretically, this mechanism generates more income and lowers impermanent loss for liquidity providers.\n\nJust a few months later, in November 2020, the 1inch Network launched 1inch V2. This upgrade primarily focused on updating the 1inch Aggregation Protocol, replacing the old routing algorithm with Pathfinder. Pathfinder \u2013 a new API \u2013\u00a0finds the best possible swap route at a faster speed than before. In addition, Pathfinder can split swaps between multiple liquidity sources and even use different market depths within the same liquidity source for a single swap, while taking gas consumption into account. 1inch V2 also widely expanded which protocols it supports from the initial three to over twenty different major liquidity protocols as well as enhance the user interface.\n\nIn December 2020, the 1INCH token was released along with the 1inch DAO, where the token could be staked on the 1inch Exchange granting the right to vote on key protocol parameters and take part in network governance.\n\nThe 1inch Limit Order Protocol was launched on June 10, 2021. Although 1inch already offered limit orders, this upgrade replaced the legacy solution forked from 0x with a more gas-efficient and customizable protocol. Besides cost-efficiency, this new protocol allows for dynamic pricing set by the user based on whatever information they find relevant and conditional execution, enabling users to specify arbitrary conditions for execution of their limit order.", "issuing_organizations": []}, "roadmap": [{"title": "Foundation of 1inch", "date": "2019-05-17T00:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": null}, {"title": "Mooniswap Launch", "date": "2020-08-10T00:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": null}, {"title": "1inch V2 Launch", "date": "2020-11-05T00:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": null}, {"title": "1inch Native Token Genesis and Initial Aidrop", "date": "2020-12-25T00:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": null}, {"title": "Second Airdrop", "date": "2021-02-12T00:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": null}, {"title": "Limit Order Protocol", "date": "2021-06-12T00:00:00Z", "type": null, "details": null}], "regulation": {"regulatory_details": null, "sfar_score": null, "sfar_summary": null}}, "contributors": {"individuals": [], "organizations": []}, "advisors": {"individuals": [], "organizations": []}, "investors": {"individuals": [{"slug": "loi-luu", "first_name": "Loi", "last_name": "Luu", "title": "CEO and Co-founder of Kyber Network", "description": null, "avatar_url": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1555545600%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DFepaVHTaXdcAP80M66zm7yEYOuUfCGD26jh7JVgjmG8"}, {"slug": "illia-polosukhin", "first_name": "Illia", "last_name": "Polosukhin", "title": "Co-Founder at NEAR Inc", "description": null, "avatar_url": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0E17C9E4-ilblackdragon.png"}], "organizations": [{"slug": "pantera-capital", "name": "Pantera Capital", "logo": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/F-asSMPT_400x400.jpg", "description": "Pantera Capital is an investment firm focused exclusively on ventures, tokens, and projects related to blockchain tech, digital currency, and crypto assets."}, {"slug": "parafi-capital", "name": "ParaFi Capital", "logo": "https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/HjNuqyoH_400x400.jpg", "description": null}, {"slug": "nima-capital", "name": "Nima Capital", "logo": null, "description": "Nima Capital is a single-family office global approach to identifying first mover companies disrupting large industries around the world."}, {"slug": "rockaway-blockchain", "name": "Rockaway Blockchain", "logo": null, "description": "We invest in promising blockchain startups, which we help to grow.

Synthetix currently supports assets that track the price of fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies and commodities. \n\nAsset Creation\nAnyone can create Synths by specifying the asset they wish to create and depositing SNX into the Synthetix smart contract so that the collateralization ratio (C-ratio) is greater than 750%. This debt created is added to a Debt Register in the amount of the new Synth minted and stored in XDR's (Synthetix Drawing Rights), which uses a basket of currencies to stabilize the value of the debt. This functions similarly to the IMF's special drawing right (SDR) and brings currency prices in through an on-chain oracle. The newly created Synths are added to the stakers wallet and must be paid back in order to receive the SNX tokens from the Synthetix smart contract. \n\nSNX holders are incentivized to stake their tokens and mint Synths in several ways. Firstly, there are staking rewards where they are compensated through protocol level inflation. From March 2019 to March 2024, the total SNX supply will increase from 100,000,000 to 245,312,500, with an annual halvening. These SNX tokens are distributed to SNX stakers on a pro-rata basis provided their C-ratio does not fall below the optimal threshold. If the C-ratio falls below the threshold, they will need to burn Synths to restore an adequate ratio. \n\nAsset Exchange \nThe second means is through Synth exchange rewards. These are generated whenever someone exchanges one Synth to another (i.e. on Synthetix.Exchange). This is done by burning the original asset and paying a 0.30% trading fee that is sent to a fee pool, available for SNX stakers to claim their proportion each week. In the same way Dai represents $1 of debt in the <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/makerdao/profile\">MakerDAO</a> system, synthetic USD (sUSD) represents $1 of debt in Synthetix.

Although with Bitcoin, being able to transfer assets/information through an actual transfer of Bitcoin is permitted, existing Bitcoin nodes are unaware that assets are embedded in the message. This also means that actual Bitcoin must be sent for every asset transaction and there could be cases where the receiving party is unaware of the asset.

RenVM is intended to be a decentralized and trustless custodian that holds your digital assets as they move between blockchains using zero-knowledge proofs over an sMPC based protocol. The state, inputs, and outputs of all programs that RenVM runs are kept hidden from everyone, including the Darknodes that power it. \n\nThis allows RenVM to securely manage <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/elliptic-curve-digital-signature-algorithm-ecdsa\">ECDSA</a> private keys on different blockchains, making it possible to shift digital assets between blockchains in a trustless, permissionless, and decentralized way.\n\nNodes that power RenVM, are referred to as Darknodes. These can be operated by any member of the public that posts a bond of 100,000 Ren tokens (REN). Projects that utilize RenVM pay a small fee to Darknodes for providing interoperability. Given the one billion maximum REN token supply (ERC-20), there is a maximum of 10,000 possible Darknodes.\n\nRen is currently in phase sub-zero where there is only one group of nodes responsible for consensus and execution and it is run by the Ren team.

Also, Bitcoin Gold's difficulty adjustment algorithm (DAA) is different: DigiShield V3. This change is intended to protect the network from abnormal changes in difficulty from significant changes in total hash power. Instead of launching immediately after the \"snapshot\" of the original chain and crediting equal balances of the fork coins to original addresses, Bitcoin Gold officially launched a few days after the chain split.

To support this vision, Kadena features a novel consensus method, a proof-of-work model dubbed Chainweb, and a new smart contract language, called Pact. Its mission is to optimize its base-layer for transaction throughput and developer adoption without the need for any second layer scalability or functionality solutions. Second layer solutions tend to complicate application development, so providing a full tool kit on a single platform is intended to be more developer-friendly. The team also claims Kadena has no upper bounds on the number of transactions it can process per second based on internal tests. \n\nKadena's native smart contract language, Pact, is designed to improve upon common flaws observed in Ethereum's Solidity, particularly its susceptibility to unbounded loops and lack of Formal Verification. Pact smart contracts can also be upgraded at any time without requiring a hard fork. \n\nKadena also built a private blockchain that predates its public smart contract platform. The private blockchain, now called Kadena Kuro (formerly ScalableBFT), uses a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism and is optimized for enterprise-grade use cases. Since 2018, Kadena Kuro has been used by a healthcare consortium to help reduce the effort required to collect and maintain insurance provider information. This private blockchain can be used similar to a side-chain with a public blockchain network (such as Kadena's public platform) to speed up transaction processes and create new marketplaces for data.\n\nThe project was founded by former members of the JPMorgan blockchain development team for Juno. Kadena has raised $15 million to date, with the majority of those funds secured in the form of SAFTs (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens).

This approach differs from sidechains, as every individual chain has the same capabilities as the main chain.\n\nChainweb is designed to increase transaction throughput linearly as new chains are added in parallel to the network. Miners target each chain individually, which lessens Kadena\u2019s mempool bottleneck relative to Bitcoin. From a security and continuity perspective, chains include a hash of their sister chains' the Merkle roots and inspect the roots to validate that the branches do not diverge. This design helps independent Kadena chains to achieve a single view of transaction history across chains. The cross-referencing of Merkle roots also serves to increase hostile-fork resistance. To relace a given block, an attack must fork every chain in the network, or, in other words, attain the cumulative hash power of every running chain.\n\nAdditional security is defined by the Merkle cone for a given block, a novel feature unique to the Kadena blockchain. Merkle cones describe what past transactions are provable and how a transaction becomes provable to the network, ideally in a trust minimized manner, as new layers are formed.

Each PoW chain mines the same currency and contains references (Merkle root subsets) to their peer chains\u2019 previous block, thus peer chains can validate each other\u2019s blocks and liquidity can be transferred between chains. This approach differs from sidechains, as every individual chain has the same capabilities as the main chain. The design of Chainweb begins with the idea of adding Bitcoin's Simple Payment Verification (SPV, the basis for lightweight clients) capability that allows users to verify a transaction without processing the entire blockchain by querying the chain for a Merkle proof. Unlike Bitcoin, Kadena is account-based, not UTXO based.\n\nIn Kadena, smart contract SPV allows for automated interchain token transfers while managing the supply of a single currency across the network. A Chainweb transfer moves a token (or tokens) by deleting it on one chain and issuing a new token on a peer chain. SPV proofs are used to verify that the initial deletion process is complete before another chain can create a new token. A deletion\u2019s transaction ID can only be consumed once, so each SPV proof of deletion can only permit the execution of a single create function.\n\nKadena uses a smart contract language Pact that was designed to be readable by humans and verifiable by computers. Rather than requiring the storage and invocation of large streams of lower-level bytecode like the EVM, the code stored within the Blockchain is exactly what the application developers wrote and is legible in its original form. Pact also provides a safe solution to implementing business logic on a blockchain such as enforcing rules with unambiguous error messages on failure, modeling and maintaining database schemas, and authorizing users to perform sensitive operations. It was purposefully designed to be Turing-incomplete with the belief that such use cases are ill-suited in a resource-constrained blockchain environment.
